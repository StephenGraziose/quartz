To record voltage, neuroscientists use the **Current Clamp Technique**.

### Current-Clamp RecordingsÂ 
- Elicit changes in membrane potential with an injection of current into a neuron
	- Ohm's Law: $V = IR$
		- Voltage = Current X Resistance
			- Changing around variables can cause different effects on voltage
				- Resistance will be a constant here
		- If the injected current does not depolarize the membrane to threshold, no action potential will occur
		- If injected current depolarizes the membrane beyond the threshold, action potentials will occur
	- Positive current (+): **Depolarization**
		- **Suprathreshold**: Action potential generation occurs
			- Literally meaning above the threshold 
		- Action potentials are all-or-none signals
			- Axon hillock is the reason for this
			- These are *inward currents due to being positive*
	- Negative current (-): **Hyperpolarization**
		- **Subthreshold**: Membrane potential is even more negative than before
		- Goes even more below threshold
			- This blocks the possibility for action potentials to form
		- These are *outward currents due to being negative*
	- Frequency coding
		- Increased magnitude of input --> Increased frequency
		- Increased duration of input --> Increased duration of the spike train
			- This just means constant occurring action potentials
				- The spike is just the big action potential
			- There is a refractory period between each action potential
		- The spike itself will be the same height always. The voltage of the action potential's spike cannot be changed
