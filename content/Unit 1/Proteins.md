**Proteins** are one of the four essential biological macromolecules, and are responsible for performing various tasks for cells as a whole. 

### Protein Synthesis

> [!info]
> 
> This is just a basic overlook of how protein synthesis occurs that is the level demanded from this course.

- **Transcription (mRNA synthesis)**
	- Occurs in the nucleus
	- This is the process where DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- mRNA is trafficked out of the nuclear pores and travels into the cytoplasm
- **Translation (Protein synthesis)**
	- Occurs in the ribosomes of the cell bodies, either in the cytoplasm or on the RER
		- Free ribosomes synthesize cytosolic (free) proteins
			- Just chill out in the cytoplasm and do things
		- RER ribosomes synthesize membrane-associated proteins
			- Proteins are destined to be membrane-bound and will be found in the plasma
			- membrane (or another membrane within the cell)
	- mRNA and tRNA work together at the ribosome to generate amino acids, which are subsequently linked together and form polypeptides
		- You remember this shit from genetics
	- After polypeptide synthesis concludes, the protein is trafficked into its final location

### Protein Structure
- **Primary structure**
	- Amino acid sequence and peptide bonds
- **Secondary structure**
	- Shapes formed by hydrogen bonding
		- Alpha-helix or beta-pleated sheet
- **Tertiary structure**
	- Additional folding and interactions formed by the R groups of the amino acids used to form the primary structure
- **Quartenary structure**
	- Association of different tertiary structures together
		- Protein subunit association
	- Ex: Channels

### Protein Classes

There are multiple different classes of proteins, which are based on their structure and also their location of synthesis and function:

#### Cytosolic proteins
- Created by free ribosomes
	- Two types:
		- **Fibrillar proteins**
			- Used in the cytoskeleton
				- Provides structural support
				- Actin, myosin
				- Creates the morphology of the neurons too
					- Dendritic spines and the shape of the dendrites, etc.
			- **Enzymes**
				- Metabolic triggers
				- Are basically biological catalysts for chemical reactions
					- Proteins that essentially do shit
				- Ex: Phosphorylate and dephosphorylate shit

#### Nuclear and mitochondrial proteins
- Translocated to the nucleus/mitochondria
	- Ex: Transcription factors, DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, etc.
- These aren't too particularly important

#### Membrane-associated proteins
- Synthesized by RER-associated ribosomes
	- Three types:
		- **Membrane-attached proteins**
			- **Integral Proteins**
				- Embedded within the membrane
					- Span the length of the plasma membrane
					- Are **amphipathic**
						- Semi polar semi nonpolar (# make sure this is accurate)
					- Ex: Ion channel, carrier protein
			- **Peripheral Proteins**
				- Bound to integral proteins and are on one specific end of the plasma membrane
					- Ex: Receptor proteins, G-protein in a GPCR
		- **ER proteins**
			- Proteins present in the ER required for basic ER functions
				- Ex: Calcium ion channels
					- Remember that the smooth ER is responsible for the storage of calcium ions 
						- Will be deposited into the ER membrane and just chill there
		- **Proteins contained within vesicles and lysosomes**
			- Ex: **Secretory products, enzymes**
-  Function
	- Ion channels/Ionotropic receptors:
		- Pores, gated, and selective towards certain ions only
		- Ex: Globular ion channels are a certain type of
	- **Transporters (ion pumps/carriers):**
		- Dependent on ATP to function
			- ATP causes changes in conformation to allow function
			- Ex: $\ce{Na+/K+}$ ion pump
	- **Anchoring proteins:**
		- Interact with the cytoskeleton
			- Includes interactions with microfilaments, which help anchor the protein such as a channel into place
	- **Cell interactions:**
		- Junctions, adhesion, migration/maturation of cells
			- Gap junctions, adhesive junctions
			- Cells going up radial glia to go to certain locations necessary
	- **Metabotropic Receptors:**
		- Trigger intracellular 2nd messenger signaling cascades
		- GPCR
