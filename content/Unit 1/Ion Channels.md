**Ion channels** are a form of integral protein within the cell membrane. They are responsible for allowing charged ions to enter the cell membrane, as ions are unable to pass through the cell membrane normally (they are repulsed by nonpolar phospholipid tails).

Ion channels are *ion selective*, having some sort of ion filter that makes it specific for one or more ions. 

Possible mechanisms for the function of ion channels includes charge, size, or with water existing in the pore.

## Types of Ion Channels

### Gated Ion Channels
- Channels open and close in response to stimulus or conditions
	- Possible mechanisms:
		- Localized within a pore or general conformational change throughout the entire channel
		- Ball and chain model
			- Ball blocks one end, but sometimes isn't there
			- This is localized within a specific pore

> More than one type of gating mechanism can exist in a channel at a time! For example, the voltage-gated $\ce{ Na+ }$ ion channel is both voltage-gated and also includes a ball and chain within the channel too!

Below are some specific gated channels: 

#### Ligand-gated Ion Channels

> [!info]
> 
> A **ligand** is a molecule that binds to a receptor surface. In reference to ligand-gated channels, a channel either opens or closes when a ligand binds to a receptor site on the channel.

- Neurotransmitter-dependent
	- Ion channel also doubles as a receptor molecule too
	- **PSP**
		- **Post-synaptic potentials**
		- Graded potentials that occur in the post-synaptic neuron due to the presence of neurotransmitters and ion transportation occurring

#### [[Voltage-Gated Channels|Voltage-Gated Ion Channels]] 
- Membrane potential-dependent
	- Certain electrical charges cause the channel to open and close
	- Voltage sensor
	- **AP**
		- **Action Potential**
		- These channels are responsible for action potentials occurring

#### Mechanically-Gated Ion Channels
- Sensitive to the stretching and changing of the shape of the membrane
	- Heavily related to cytoskeletal activity
	- **Receptor potential**
		- The electrical potential formed by a sensory receptor instead of a synaptic neuron
		- This is also a type of graded potential

#### Second Messenger-Gated Ion Channels
- *Phosphorylation-dependent*
	- When cAMP and other second messengers throw phosphate onto this channel, it does something
	- G-protein-gated

> [!warning] Careful!
> 
> Second messenger-gated ion channels are *NOT* metabotropic, and do not respond to other chemicals. They are part of second messenger systems, however.

### Leak Channels
- Some channels do not have any gated mechanisms
	- Are known as **leak channels**
- Contribute heavily to **RMP** 
	- [[Resting Membrane Potential]]
	- Leak channels essentially form the resting membrane potential of a neuron
		- ~-65mV or so
