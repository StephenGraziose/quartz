**Membrane potential** is the charge of the cell membrane. Because of all of the charged species (both ions and proteins) inside and outside of the cell, the cell membrane is *electrically polarized* at rest. Typically, the **resting membrane potential** of a neuron is about -65mV

### Generation of Resting Membrane Potential
- Resting potential of neurons generated by the combination of $\ce{K+, Na+, and Cl-}$ leak channels
	- Resting potential is now a function of both:
		- **Ion concentration gradients (of the three different ions)**
		- **Ion permeability (P)**
			- This is equal to the "weighting" factor of each ion
			- How many leak channels are present for the ion
- **Goldman Katz equation** for resting potential:
$$\ce{V_{m} = 61.5\log\frac{P_{K+}[K+]_{outside} + P_{Na+}[Na+]_{outside} + P_{Cl-}[Cl-]_{outside}}{P_{K+}[K+]_{inside} + P_{Na+}[Na+]_{inside} + P_{Cl-}[Cl-]_{inside}}}$$	 
	- Essentially like an averaging for the ion equilibrium potentials
- *Ok, but why is Vm = -65mV at rest?*
    - This is because the $\mathbf{\ce{P_{K+} >> P_{Na+} and P_{Cl-}}}$
	- The potassium ion has a much higher ion permeability than the chloride or sodium ions
		- There are a whole lot more potassium ion leak channels
	- Different neurons have different rations of PK+:PNa+:PCl-
	- Reminder that this is pretty close to EK+ (~-80mV)

### Ion Pumps
- Na+/K+ Pump
	- Contains ATPase enzyme
		- Dephosphorylates ATP into ADP and phosphate, and uses that phosphate to power itself
	- Restores ion gradients after action potentials
		- Basically acts as the janitor
	- Maintains resting membrane potential
	- Electrogenic
		- **3 Na+ OUT**
		- **2 K+ IN**
		- Generates an outward current
		- Hyperpolarizes the membrane
		- Active transport, goes AGAINST the concentration gradient

- Cl- Pump
	- **Cl- pumped OUT**
		- Reminder that there is *more Cl- outside of the cell than inside of the cell*

- The intracellular environments of neurons are more negatively charged than the extracellular environments of neurons
	- <u>Cytosol is negatively charged</u>
	- <u>ECM is positively charged</u>
- Membrane potential = $V_{m}$
	- $V_{m} = V_{inside} - V_{outside}$
	- $V_{m}$= -50mV to -70mV
		- Varies based on organism and cell type, but usually will be referred to as **-65mV**
- **Electrical potential (V)**
	- Measured in voltage
	- Voltage is measured in millivolts for neurons (mV)
        - Electrical potential is essentially the potential to generate an electrical current
		- The plasma membrane is equivalent to a battery
		- If you were to open up a bridge between the intracellular and extracellular space, ions would flow between these spaces

Membrane potential is essentially established by **ion movement:**
- Two forces in particular are acting on ions to control ion movement:
	- **Chemical forces**
		- Ions flow down chemical concentration gradients
	- **Electrical forces**
		- Like charges repel
		- Opposite charges attract
		- Electrostatic interactions
- These forces can overcome each other based on their strengths
	- **Electrical current (I)**
		- Movement of charge
		- Measured in milliamperes in neurons and cells (mA)
		- The current direction = The direction of the flow of positive charge
