**Neuron morphology** is the shape and appearance of a [[Neurons|neuron]]. Neurons can differ in the morphologies of their dendrites, known as **dendritic morphology.** This ends up also affecting the functionality of the neurons as well.

### Dendritic Morphologies

#### Unipolar
- One pole, axon and some dendrites from one pole
	- Mostly in invertebrates, so who gives a flying fuck about these

#### Bipolar
- Soma in the middle, two poles projecting on top of and on the bottom of it (if you think about it standing in front of you)
	- Found frequently in the retina and used for vision
	- These neurons have limited inputs
		- Have a lower surface area

#### Pseudounipolar
- Soma branches off from one exact pole
	- Looks like one pole, is actually two
		- Usually are sensory neurons

#### Multipolar
- Multiple poles branching from the soma, one distinct axon, many many dendrites
	- These neurons have multiple inputs
		- Have a higher surface area
- These are the stereotypical neurons
