**Neurons** are a major category of cells in the Nervous System. They are responsible for transferring and transmitting information throughout the nervous system.

Neurons form circuits and networks with each other. One of the most major forms of this is the [[Synapses|synapse]], with there being over 100 trillion synapses existing.

There are 100 billion to 1 trillion neurons within the nervous system.

The [[Neuron Morphology|structure of a neuron]] heavily influences its function.

Neurons contain five incredibly vital components:

#### Soma
- This is also known as the *cell body* or the *perikaryon*, and contains the **nucleus**. 
	- It is literally the body of the neuron, and looks pyramidal sometimes.
	- The nucleus is what contains the genetic machinery of the cell.
- The soma is responsible for protein synthesis and packaging too.
- The soma is one of the *input components* of the neuron

#### Dendrites
- Dendrites are a projection that occurs from an end of the neuron 
	- Look like tree branches
	- There are two types of projection of dendrites: Apical and Basal:
		- *Apical*: Extend from the apex of the pyramidal shape of the neuron
			- There will be like an outward projection that contains these dendrites 
		- *Basal*: Extend from the base of the pyramidal shape of the neuron
			- These dendrites kinda just immediately jut out from the base of the cell body 
- Dendrites are responsible for *receiving synaptic inputs*
	- Bring information into the neuron for additional processing
- **Dendritic spines**:
	- These are small spines that increase the amount of information received by dendrites
		- They grow on the dendritic branch
		- Look like little bumps
		- They contain additional ligand-gated ion channels for excitatory information
	- **Spiny** **dendrites** are dendrites that have spines 
	- **Aspiny** **dendrities** are dendrites that lack spines   
- The dendrites are the other *input component* of the neuron

#### Axon Hillock
- The **axon hillock** is located between the axon and the soma, and is like the beginning portion of the axon
	- It is literally called the *initial segment*
- The axon hillock is the *integrative component* of the neuron
- Provides an **all-or-none response**

#### Axon
- **Axons** are another neuron projection, and are responsible for conducting and transmitting [[The Action Potential|action potentials]]
	- All neurons have at least one axon
- Axons have projections off of them called **collaterals**
- Some, but not all of them, are wrapped in a **myelin sheath** that improves conduction
	- The myelin sheath is a layer of proteins and lipids that insulate and protect the axons
	- This is through both saltatory conduction and electrical insulation
- Axons are considered the *conductile component* of the neuron

#### Axon Terminal
- Junctions with postsynaptic cells
	- FormsÂ [[synapses]]
		- These are connections with other neurons
- The axon terminal is known as the *output component* of the neuron
