**Neuronal Information Transfer** is the process of conveying information between different neurons, and is used for the body to essentially "talk" to itself.

Comes in the form of various different methods:

### [[Synapses]]

- Signal generation and propagation
	- To understand this, we're gonna focus on ionic currents, neuronal membranes, and synaptic potentials
		• We'll also focus on neurotransmitters and neuron receptors
		‣ Pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons
	◦ **Neural circuits** are also established through synapses
		‣ Ex: Simple sensory circuits
			• *Muscle reflexes*
		‣ Ex: Complex sensory circuits
			• Eye and the retina
				◦ God I fucking hate eyes
