Many molecules and vesicles will need to flow down the [[Neurons#Axon|axon]] in order for them to be transported to the axon terminal and to the synaptic end-bulbs.

Axonal transport has 3 different forms within neurons:

### Fast Anterograde Axonal Transport:
- Synaptic vesicles and secretory granules use this to reach the axon terminals
	- Essential for [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]] operation
	- ATP dependent
		- This is a format of active transport
		- ATP powers this transport
	- **Kinesin** is a motor protein involved in this process
		- Kinesin uses ATP to essentially "walk" across the microtubules
		- Kinesin can travel across microtubules about~400mm/day
	- *Moves from cell body to axon terminal*

### Retrograde Axonal Transport:
- Degradation/recycling of [[proteins]] back into the cell body
	- Basically the opposite of anterograde axonal transport
	- *Moves from axon terminal to cell body*
	- **Dynein** is a motor protein involved in this process
	- Fast as well, but not as fast as fast anterograde axonal transport
		- Dynein moves about 2/3rd of the speed along the microtubules as kinesin does
	- This is a format of active transport too
		- Dynein requires ATP to function

### Slow Axoplasmic Flow (Anterograde):
- Cytosolic proteins (enzymes, [[cytoskeleton]])
	- Passive transport through the cytoplasm
		- Flow of molecules down their concentration gradients
			- It is anterograde because there are more proteins in the cell body than the axon terminals usually
			- *Moves from cell body to axon terminal*
	- Very slow
		- 0.2mm - 0.5mm of travel/day
	- No motor proteins are involved in this at all
