#### Date: 1/23/23

# Notes:

- Why care about glia?
    - Glia are involved in many neuron processes:
        - Neuronal scaffolding
            - Making neurons grow into the shapes and also the places they need to be
        - Metabolic support
            - Provide glucose and other nutrient support
        - Forming the **blood-brain barrier**
            - Regulatory barrier for protection against substances that may harm the brain
        - Immune function
        - Digest debris
        - Myelination
        - Modulate synaptic activity
        - Many many more
            - They are essentially required for basic nervous system function
- Glial cells are **non-neuronal** cells of the CNS and PNS
    - They do not propagate action potentials at all
        - They CAN have electrical activity, but not action potential worthy things
    - They divide in adulthood
        - Neurons cannot
        - Some glial cells are neuron progenitor cells
    - They are cellularly diverse
        - Neurons also are diverse too
- There are multiple types of glial cells:
    - [[Schwann cells]]
        - PNS
        - Forms **myelin sheaths** around myelinated axons
        - Ensheath unmyelinated axons
        - Functions:
            - **Myelination**
                - Basically wrap their entire bodies around a segment of the axon
            - **Biochemical/structural support** of myelinated/unmyelinated axons
        - Some axons do not need to be myelinated, do not have a purpose for high-speed communication
            - Schwann cells can help stabilize and assist these unmyelinated cells
        - Structure:
            - Tight spiral wrapping of fused plasma membrane to form a**sheath** around larger or more intermediate-diameter axons
                - Trojan Magnums for axons
            - Invaginations for small axons
                - Done by **non-myelinating Schwann cells**
    - [[Oligodendrocytes]]
        - CNS
            - Form myelin sheaths around CNS axons in white matter areas
                - Remember that white matter is axons
            - Surround neuronal cell bodies in gray matter
                - Remember that gray matter is cell bodies
        - Functions:
            - **Myelination**
                - Small arms of the cell encase and surround portions of the axon with myelin
            - Metabolic support/extracellular regulation
        - Structure
            - Processes (mini arms) of the individual oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths around all but the smallest axons
            - **Nodes of Ranvier** between myelin segments similar to that of the PNS
                - These are spaces in between the myelinated segments
                    - Help with saltatory conduction
            - **Perineuronal:** 
                - Oligodendrocytes with no processes/myelin
                - Up in the air with what they do
    - [[Astrocytes]]
        - CNS
            - Most abundant cell type
            - Found throughout the CNS
                - Neuronal cell bodies
                - Dendrites
                - Axons
                - Terminals
            - Form a complete lining around:
                - Every single external surfaces of the CNS
                    - Ex: If nerve tissue covers the meninges or a blood vessel, astrocytes will be there to line that nerve tissue
                - CNS blood vessels
            - Adult terminal astrocytes stay in their location, but can have a plastic structure
                - Their processes can grow and change locations, changing which neurons they communicate with
            - **Fibrous astrocytes** are found in white matter
                - Fibrous in nature and also hang out by fibers
                - Helps out axons
                    - Remember, white matter is axons
            - **Protoplasmic astrocytes** are found in gray matter
                - Can do things like feed neurons or regulate neurotransmitters, etc.
                    - Remember that cell bodies are gray matter
                - Have more intermediate filaments
                    - Super thick non dynamic cytoskeletal proteins
        - Functions:
            - Maintenance of **extracellular ionic environment**
                - Ions are moving into the neurons to create messages
                - This environment is regulated and supported by the astrocytes
            - Secretion of **growth factors**
            - **Structural/metabolic support**
                - Feeding neurons glucose and stuff
            - **Take up/release neurotransmitters**
                - Either removes excess neurotransmitters or dumps out more
                - Can prevent excitotoxicity
                    - Removes glutamate when it is in excess
                - This is referred to as **neuromodulation**
                    - Using multiple different types of neurotransmitters to regulate communication and other forms of messaging
                    - Sometimes astrocytes dump neurotransmitters into blood vessels to spread neuroinflammatory signals and other messages
        - Structure:
            - Contain processes (little arms) just like oligodendrocytes
                - Project and touch neuron surfaces
            - Stellate, highly branched cells
            - End-feet join together to line interfaces between CNS and other tissues
    - [[Microglia]]
        - CNS
            - Found in gray and white matter
            - Hang out in the areas where they are born
        - Functions:
            - **Scavenging/phagocytosis of debris** following cell injury/death
            - Secretion of **cytokines**
                - Done a lot by reactive microglia
            - **Maintain homeostasis**
        - Structure
            - **Reactive microglia** migrate to damaged areas and proliferate
                - Large, amoeboid shape
            - **Ramified microglia** survey blood/neurons/glia with very long processes
            - Very tiny by comparison to other cells
            - These two above structures appear to be like different forms of the microglia
                - Normally in the ramified state, but convert to the reactive state when issues are detected
                    - Chemicals that bind to receptors on their processes are what they are looking for/are what they detect
    - [[Satellite cells]]
        - PNS
            - Surrounding neuron cell bodies in the PNS ganglia
                - Reminder that ganglia are where PNS cell bodies are found
                - Named because they're like satellites to PNS neurons
        - Functions:
            - Regulate the external chemical environment
        - Structure:
            - Small cells connected by gap junctions
                - Gap junctions allow for ions and small communicating molecules to directly pass between cells
            - NOT star shaped
        - PNS partial counterpart of astrocytes
    - [[Radial glia]]
        - CNS
            - In the developing CNS

            - Formation of the blood-CSF barrier
        - Structure:
            - Cuboidal with cilia
- Macrophages are not glial cells, but they are the PNS counterpart of microglia in the CNS
    - Peripheral immune system
- Overall, glial cells are essentially support cells for neurons that form a matrix for, support, and nourish, neurons
- Sample test question:
    - Astrocytes can perform all of the following _EXCEPT:_
        - Answers can include information about location AND function
            - This appears to be an "advanced" question according to her
                - "Highest amount of information you would need to know for glial cells"
- Glial cells originate during prenatal development _(DO NOT NEED TO KNOW FOR TEST)_
    - Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes originate from the ectoderm
        - Pyramidal neurons and interneurons also originate from the ectoderm
            - Check the diagram, some of the cells originate from the same line

                    - Ex: Connexin32
                - Dysfunctional gap junctions cause impaired transfer of ions and nutrients across myelin to innermost myelin layers and axons
                - Causes myelin degeneration in the PNS
            - Multiple Sclerosis
                - Autoimmune disorder
                    - Immune cells recognize myelin as foreign for some reason, attack and destroy
                    - Demyelination causes astrocyte plaque (sclerosis)
                    - Disrupt action potentials
                        - Think frayed wires
                    - Potential remission before plaque forms
                        - If plaque forms, no way to revert
