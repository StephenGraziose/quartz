# Notes:

- Driving Force
    - **Electrochemical driving force:**
        - Electrical driving force + Chemical driving force
        - Equation: $\mathbf{EDF_{ion} = V_{m} - E_{ion}}$
            - $V_{m}$ = Membrane potential
            - $E_{ion}$ = Ion electric potential
            - When ions are at their equilibrium, ions would not flow across the membrane because their driving forces cancel out
                - Ex: When a neuron is at the exact voltage that is that of the equilibrium potential of an ion, the ion will not flow inwards nor outwards
                    - No net movement
        - For potassium, if the cell has too strong of a negative membrane potential, it will overcome the concentration gradient and potassium will rush into the cell because the cell membrane is so strongly negative
            - At rest, there is a ton of natural potassium efflux
        - For chloride, the resting membrane potential and chloride's equilibrium potential are nearly equal
    - This determines the direction and force of ion flow
        - Direction: Inwards or outwards current
    - There are no Ca2+ leak channels, but it has the strongest driving force
        - ECa2+ = +250mV
        - This is due to a variety of reasons
            - There is almost NO calcium ions within the neuron
            - Calcium ions have a +2 charge
    - Reminder that neurons have leak K+, Na+, and Cl- channels in their membranes!
- Generation of Resting Membrane Potential (RMP):
    - Resting potential of neurons generated by the combination of K+, Na+, and Cl- leak channels
    - Resting potential is now a function of both:
        - **Ion concentration gradients (of the three different ions)**
        - **Ion permeability (P)**
            - This is equal to the "weighting" factor of each ion
            - How many leak channels are present for the ion
    - **Goldman Katz equation** for resting potential:
        - Vm (at 37 degrees C) = 61.5*log((PK+[K+]o + PNa+[Na+]o + PCl-[Cl-]o)/(PK+[K+]i + PNa+[Na+]i + PCl-[Cl-]i))
            - O = outside cell
            - I = inside cell
        - Essentially like an averaging for the ion equilibrium potentials
- Ok, but why is Vm = -60mV at rest?
    - This is because the PK+ >> PNa+ and PCl-
        - The potassium ion has a much higher ion permeability than the chloride or sodium ions
            - There are a whole lot more potassium ion leak channels
    - Different neurons have different rations of PK+:PNa+:PCl-
    - Reminder that this is pretty close to EK+ (~-80mV)
- Ion Pumps
    - Na+/K+ Pump
        - Contains ATPase enzyme
            - Dephosphorylates ATP into ADP and phosphate, and uses that phosphate to power itself
        - Restores ion gradients after action potentials
            - Basically acts as the janitor
        - Maintains resting membrane potential
        - Electrogenic
            - 3 Na+ OUT
            - 2 K+ IN
            - Generates an outward current
            - Hyperpolarizes the membrane
            - Active transport, goes AGAINST the concentration gradient
    - Cl- Pump
        - Cl- pumped OUT
        - Reminder that there is more Cl- outside of the cell than inside of the cell
- On the exam, will get Nernst Equation or Goldman-Katz Equation questions
    - Will need to understand how they work, what they mean, what each variable means
- Generating the Membrane Potential
    - Remember how the concentration gradients work as a baseline
    - Know which leak channels exist in the membrane, and in which proportion
        - No Ca2+ leak channels
        - Out of these three remaining leak channels, K+ >> Na+ and Cl-
