# Notes:

- Cells are the functional units of the nervous system
    - Function through various means
        - Electrical signaling
        - Chemical signaling
        - Intracellular processes
            - Within a cell
        - Intercellular processes
            - Between cells
        - Forming circuits
        - Support from neighboring cells
        - Modulation from neighboring cells
    - The structure of a cell influences the function of a cell, and vice versa
- Neurons and glia
    - [[Neurons]]
        - Transfer information
        - Form circuits and networks with each other
        - There are 100 billion - 1 trillion neurons
        - There are approximately 100 trillion **synapses** (connections between neurons)
    - [[Glia]]
        - Support cells
        - Maintain an environment for neurons to function
            - Neurons do not live in a vacuum, instead they coexist with glia to survive and function
        - Allow neurons to signal
        - Receive signals from neurons
        - Transmits signals to neurons
        - There are 2 - 50 trillion glial cells
- [[Neuron Morphology]] (four components)
    - **Soma** (cell body, perikaryon):
        - Contains a **Nucleus**
            - Contains the genetic machinery of the cell
        - Protein synthesis and packaging
        - Sometimes "pyramidal" in shape
        - Is literally the body of the neuron
    - **Dendrites:**
        - Look like tree branches
        - Apical/basal:
            - **Apical:** Extend from the apex of the pyramidal shape of the neuron
                - There will be like an outward projection that contains these dendrites
            - **Basal:** Extend from the base of the pyramidal shape of the neuron
                - These dendrites kinda just immediately jut out from the base of the cell body
        - Receive synaptic inputs
            - Bring information into the neuron for additional processing
        - **Dendritic spines:**
            - These are small spines that increase the amount of information received by dendrites
            - They grow on the dendritic branch
                - Look like little bumps
            - **Spiny dendrites** are dendrites that have spines
            - **Aspiny dendrities** are dendrites that lack spines
    - **Axon:**
        - All neurons have a single axon
        - Have multiple branches
            - These are called **collaterals**
            - All collaterals originate from a single axon
        - Have an **axon hillock**
            - This is the also known as the initial segment of the axon
            - **All-or-none response**
        - Axons projections:
            - Intrinsic projection
            - Extrinsic projection
        - Some, but not all, axons are wrapped in a **myelin sheath** that improves conduction
            - Saltatory conduction, electrical insulation, etc.
    - **Axon Terminal:**
        - Junctions with postsynaptic cells
        - Forms **synapses**
            - These are connections with other neurons
            - Interestingly enough, synapses are actually spaces between a pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neuron
- Ramon y Cajal vs Golgi
    - **Neuron Doctrine (Cajal)**
        - Neurons are separate units
        - Communicate across gaps
        - Dendrites receive information
        - Turns out to be the right answer
            - Suck it, Golgi
    - **Reticular Theory (Golgi)**
        - There is a reticulum of axons and neurons
        - Continuous cytoplasm
        - Dendrites provide nutrients
- Information flow through neurons
    - Neuron polarity
        - Directionality of information flow:
            - Information goes from dendrites --> soma --> axon hillock --> axon --> axon terminal
            - Pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons
                - Upstream vs downstream
            - The directionality is relative to a given synapse
        - Dendrites
            - Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs
            - Passive conductance of signals (passive graded potentials)
                - Means that charged ions enter passively, and the concentration of ions entering and leaving causes a relative effect
        - Axon
            - Axon hillock summates all EPSPs and IPSPs and decides if an action potential occurs
                - All or nothing response
            - Active signal conductance (action potential)
        - Axon terminal
            - Synaptic transmission from pre-synaptic neuron to post-synaptic neuron
        - **Backpropagation of signals** -- exception to the rule
            - Active signal conductance backwards in dendrites
                - Retrograde transmission via dendritic transmitters
                - Essentially, information can travel backwards in the dendrites
    - Transformation of signals **(transduction)**
    - Passive and active signals
        - Passive = Graded potentials
- More about [[Neuron Morphology|neuron morphologies]]
    - Morphology = Cellular shape
    - Dendritic morphologies
        - Unipolar
            - One pole, axon and some dendrites from one pole
            - Mostly in invertebrates, so who gives a flying fuck about these
        - Bipolar
            - Soma in the middle, two poles projecting on top of and on the bottom of it (if you think about it standing in front of you)
            - Found frequently in the retina and used for vision
            - These neurons have limited inputs
                - Have a lower surface area
        - Pseudounipolar
            - Soma branches off from one exact pole
                - See the diagram
            - Looks like one pole, is actually two
            - Usually are sensory neurons
        - Multipolar
            - Multiple poles branching from the soma, one distinct axon, many many dendrites
            - These neurons have multiple inputs
                - Have a higher surface area
    - The morphology of neurons reflects the function of neurons
- Functional components of neurons and signal transformation
    - Apical and basal dendrites and also the soma: **The input component**
        - Receives information from other neurons
        - Reminder that these are graded potentials (passive signal)
        - Dendrites have chemical/mechanical/voltage gated ion channels on them and their dendritic spines
            - This is how they acquire information
    - Axon hillock: **The integrative component**
        - Summates EPSPs and IPSPs, generates an action potential (active signal)
        - Action potentials are coded in number and frequency
        - Action potentials are **all or none** responses
        - Threshold is the trigger level needed to be crossed in order to generate an action potential
    - Axon: **The conductile component**
        - Conducts and propagates the action potential
        - This is also all-or-none conduction
        - Action potential is carried along the axon to the axon terminals
    - Axon terminals: **The output component**
        - Synapse with postsynaptic neurons
        - Synaptic end bulbs release neurotransmitters to communicate with other neurons
        - The action potential number and the frequency are converted to the quantity of neurotransmitters released
            - More action potentials = More transmitters released
- Information flow through neuronal circuits
    - Monosynaptic circuits: The most simple neuronal circuits
        - There are four functional components in two types of neurons and muscle fibers
            - Input
                - Dendrites receive informations and transmit graded potentials
            - Integrative
                - Axon hillock summates graded potentials and may generate an action potential
                - **Suprathreshold input** = Input that exceeds the threshold
            - Conductile
                - Axon conducts action potential to the axon terminal
            - Output
                - Release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft
        - Transformation of signals in a neuron during the knee-jerk reflex
            - Mechanical (the hammer hitting) --> Passive electrical (graded potential) --> Active electrical (action potential) --> Chemical (neurotransmitter)
            - This process is referred to as **transduction**
- Universal Model of Neuron Function
    - Although nearly all neurons have incredibly variable morphologies and functions, almost every neuron has the same functional organization
        - Sensory, motor, neuroendocrine cells, interneurons, projection neurons, etc.
        - Excitatory and inhibitory neurons
