# Notes:

- Why are we learning about the [[Cell Membrane|cell membrane]] and ion channels?
    - **Plasma membrane**
        - Separates the inside and outside of a cell
        - Contains structures to allow materials inside and outside of the cell
    - **Ion channels**
        - Allow charged particles (ions) to cross the cell membrane
        - Generates electrical potentials
            - The difference between charges across a membrane
        - Movement of ions essentially creates electricity
    - This is all essential towards how neurons are electrically excitable and how they communicate and create signals
- Ionic Environments
    - Intracellular ionic environment
        - The ionic environment within a cell
    - Extracellular ionic environment
        - The ionic environment outside of and between cells
    - Aqueous
        - Immersed in water
            - Polar molecule
                - Has positive and negative electrostatic poles
                    - Asymmetrical charge distribution
    - Salts
        - $\ce{NaCl, KCl, CaCl2}$
            - These are compounds that are able to dissociate into ionic components
                - $\ce{K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Na+}$
        - Dissolve in $\ce{H2O}$
- [[Cell Membrane#Phospholipid Bilayer|Phospholipid Bilayer]]
    - **Phospholipid**
        - Chains of fatty acids that contain phosphate heads
            - Have polar heads and nonpolar tails
                - This makes them **amphipathic**
                    - Essentially semi-polar
                    - **Hydrophobic (nonpolar) and hydrophilic (polar)** at the same time (different portions of the molecule)
    - **Bilayer**
        - Two sheets
        - Hydrophobic tails face each other
            - Form the inner center of the cell membrane
        - Hydrophilic heads face away from each other
            - Are on the inner and outer faces of the cell membrane
        - Impermeable to large molecules, polar molecules, and/or ions
    - The phospholipid bilayer is like a fluid mosaic
        - Fluid mosaic model yaddah yaddah
        - Membrane proteins are freely floating and moving around
    - Membrane proteins
        - Integral membrane proteins include:

        - Peripheral membrane proteins include:
            - Proteins associated with ion channels and ion pumps and transporters

            - Combination of carbohydrates and proteins
- Integral Membrane Proteins
    - **Extracellular Domain**
        - Form interactions with the environment
            - Ex: Receptor binding sites
    - **Intracellular Domain**
        - Responsible for intracellular signaling
        - Form interactions with the cytoskeleton
            - Anchoring the channel where it needs to be or signaling the structure of the neuron
        - Also the part where certain things attach
            - Ex: G protein of the GPCR
    - **Fluid Mosaic Model**
        - Lipids and proteins are freely "floating" in the membrane
        - Microfilaments are responsible for protein anchoring and migration
        - Cholesterol is responsible for maintaining the fluidity of the cell membrane
- Membrane Proteins
    - [[Proteins#Protein Structure|Protein Structure]]
        - **Primary structure**
            - Amino acid sequence and peptide bonds
        - **Secondary structure**
            - Shapes formed by hydrogen bonding
                - Alpha-helix or beta-pleated sheet
        - **Tertiary structure**
            - Additional folding and interactions formed by the R groups of the amino acids used to form the primary structure
        - **Quartenary structure**
            - Association of different tertiary structures together
                - Protein subunit association
            - Ex: Channels
    - Function
        - Ion channels/Ionotropic receptors:
            - Pores, gated, and selective towards certain ions only
            - Ex: Globular ion channels are a certain type of
        - Transporters (ion pumps/carriers):
            - Dependent on ATP to function
                - ATP causes changes in conformation to allow function
                - Ex: $\ce{Na+/K+}$ ion pump
        - Anchoring proteins:
            - Interact with the cytoskeleton
                - Includes interactions with microfilaments, which help anchor the protein such as a channel into place
        - Cell interactions:
            - Junctions, adhesion, migration/maturation of cells
                - Gap junctions, adhesive junctions
                - Cells going up radial glia to go to certain locations necessary
        - Metabotropic Receptors:
            - Trigger intracellular 2nd messenger signaling cascades
            - GPCR
- Carriers vs Channels
    - Carriers involve a change in shape in order to carry ions past the cell membrane
        - Some carriers do this through passive transport, others require ATP for these conformations
    - Channels just allow ions to flow right through (like a tunnel that they can go through)
- [[Ion Channels]]
    - Transmembrane (Integral) Proteins
        - Amphipathic
        - Pore forming
            - Are thus aqueous
    - Channels are ion selective
        - Have some sort of ion filter
        - Specific or nonspecific
            - Sometimes specific for multiple ions at the same time
                - Doesn't that just make it essentially general?
            - Some can straight up take anything with a charge
        - $\ce{Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca^2+}$ channels
        - Possible mechanisms involve charge, size, or with water that exists within the pore
            - Size can be too big
            - Charge can be not the right type or strength
    - Gated Ion Channels
        - Channels open and close in response to stimulus or conditions
        - Possible mechanisms:
            - Localized within a pore or general conformational change throughout the entire channel
            - Ball and chain model
                - Ball blocks one end, but sometimes isn't there
                    - Check the slide for additional information
                - This is localized within a specific pore
        - Some channels do not have any gated mechanisms
            - Are known as leak channels
        - More than one gate can be in a channel
            - Ex: Voltage-gated AND ball and chain at the same time
                - This is the thing with voltage-gated $\ce{ Na+ }$ channels
        - These gating mechanisms are crucial for regulating the transmission of ions across the cell membrane
- Types of Ion Channels
    - Leak
        - No gating mechanisms, freely open and close randomly
        - **RMP** 
            - **Resting membrane potential**
            - Leak channels form the resting membrane potential of a neuron
                - ~-70mV or so
    - Ligand-Gated
        - Neurotransmitter-dependent
        - Ion channel also doubles as a receptor molecule too
        - **PSP**
            - **Post-synaptic potentials**
            - Graded potentials that occur in the post-synaptic neuron due to the presence of neurotransmitters and ion transportation occurring
    - 2nd Messenger-Gated
        - NOT METABOTROPIC
            - DO NOT RESPOND TO OTHER CHEMICALS
        - Phosphorylation-dependent
            - When cAMP and other second messengers throw phosphate onto this channel, it does something
        - G-protein-gated
    - Voltage-Gated
        - Membrane potential-dependent
            - Certain electrical charges cause the channel to open and close
        - Voltage sensor
        - **AP**
            - **Action Potential**
    - Mechanically-Gated
        - Sensitive to the stretching and changing of the shape of the membrane
            - Heavily related to cytoskeletal activity
        - **Receptor potential**
            - The electrical potential formed by a sensory receptor instead of a synaptic neuron
            - This is also a type of graded potential
    - Nomenclature is in the format of "type of ion channel, ion sensitivity"
- **Ion Transporters**
    - Essentially ion pumps
    - Movement of charged particles which requires energy expenditure
        - Format of active transport
            - Uses ATP
        - $\ce{Na+/K+}$ pump (ATPase):
            - Pumps **3 Na+ out of the cell in exchange for 2 K+ into the cell**
                - Remember that you have more potassium inside the neuronand more sodium outside of the neuron
                    - "Neurons are salty bananas"
            - The (ATPase) refers to the fact that the pump is partially an enzyme that removes phosphate from ATP to phosphorylate the channel
                - This causes a conformational change in the channel to occur
            - Helps reset ionic concentrations after action potentials occur
                - Moves against the formed chemical concentration gradient
