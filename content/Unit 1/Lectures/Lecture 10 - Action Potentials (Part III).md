# Notes:

- [[Recording Currents#Recording Single Channel Currents|Recording Single Channel Currents]]
    - This is done using the **Patch Clamp Technique**
        - Patch clamp checks the current of a single ion channel
            - Super small section that is being clamped that it can be only one ion channel
        - Remember that when we inject current to measure voltage:
            - Upward deflection mean outward current
            - Downward deflection mean inward current
    - Single channel currents = Rectangular currents
        - On/Off = all or none
            - Channel is either open or closed
        - Different channels = Different conductance
            - Different conductance means different amplitude of waves
        - Current flow dependent on the time the channel is open, as well as the frequency of opening
- Voltage sensitivity
    - Depolarization sensitive
    - Single current amplitude is a function of membrane voltage potential (Vm)
        - If the membrane was polarized a whole lot, the amplitude of a single current would be different
            - Due to the driving force of the ion being modified
            - For K+ channels, more depolarized cell membrane means stronger amplitude peaks due to the K+ ions being further repelled out of the cell
    - Increased channel opening probability with depolarization
- [[Recording Currents#Recording Whole Cell Currents|Whole Cell Currents]]
    - Macroscopic currents
        - Summated single ion channel currents for the whole cell
    - Current direction/amplitude is a function of the unitary currents that add up to form the whole cell current
    - Instead of patch clamp, you check the current across the WHOLE CELL
    - Basically averages out to a smooth wave
- Be able to determine if currents are inwards or outwards, if it is Na+ or K+, and whole cell currents
- Action Potential Currents
    - Sodium currents
        - Inward currents
            - Na+ enters the cell
            - Graph reads downwards
        - Single channel currents summate
        - Causes depolarization (AP rising phase)
            - Membrane is becoming more positive
    - Potassium currents
        - Outward currents
            - K+ exits the cell
            - Graph reads upwards
        - Single channel currents summate
        - Causes hyperpolarization (AP falling phase)
    - Differences in Na+ and K+ Current
        - Na+ current: rapid, inactivating
            - Remember that the Na+ channel can deactivate and inactivate
        - K+ current: slow, noninactivating
            - Remember that the K+ channel only deactivates
                - And does it slowly at that
- Na+ and K+ Conductances
    - Na+ conductance:
        - Rapid onset (activation)
        - Rapid offset (inactivation)
        - Remember, this stuff turns on and off fast
    - K+ conductance
        - Slow onset (activation)
        - Slow offset (deactivation)
        - Afterhyperpolarization is caused (the undershoot)
        - Remember, this stuff turns on and off pretty slow
- [[The Action Potential#Refractory Periods|Refractory period]]
    - **Absolute refractory period**
        - The inactivation of Na+ channels
        - Immediately after the spike
        - Literally causes the inactivation gate to close up (ball begins to block the pore)
            - Waiting period happens for the Na+ channel to fully deinactivate
                - The ball finally stops blocking the pore
        - No matter the strength of the stimulus, the absolute refractory period cannot be overcome
    - **Relative refractory period**
        - The afterhyperpolarization event that occurs after the action potential
        - Corrected by active transport of Na+ and K+
        - Can be overcome if an applied stimulus is strong enough
        - Na+ channel finally deinactivates
