# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 2/10/23

# Notes:

- Initial [[Action Potential Conduction|conduction of the action potential]]
    - Combined graded potentials and active signaling
    - Passive spread of cations down the axoplasm
        - Graded potentials occur in the ion channels on the axon membrane
    - Depolarization of the cell membrane
    - Once the threshold is crossed, the action potential occurs
- Regeneration of action potential occurs across the axon
- The membrane experiencing the refractory period will be located upstream of the axon during the action potential
    - This prevents any possible back propagation during the middle of an action potential event
- If we stimulated an axon in its center experimentally, it would cause the spread of an action potential in both directions
    - This is because there was no previous refractory period occurring in either direction of the start site
- Factors influencing conduction velocity
    - **Axonal diameter**
        - Larger diameter axons have faster conduction velocity
            - More lanes on a highway
        - Smaller diameter axons have slower conduction velocity
    - **Myelin**
        - Myelin speeds up conduction velocity due to insulating the axon and causing a process known as **saltatory conduction** to occur
- **Saltatory conduction**
    - Only occurs in myelinated axons
        - [[Schwann cells]] in PNS myelinate
        - [[Oligodendrocytes]] in CNS myelinate
    - Myelinated axons contain distinct components
        - **Nodes of Ranvier**
            - Gaps between the myelin sheath
            - Super high Na+ channel density
            - Increased membrane capacitance (Cm)
            - Decreased membrane resistance
            - Conduction slows
                - Replenishing Na+ ions
        - **Internodes**
            - The chunky myelin bits between the nodes of Ranvier
            - Fewer Na+ channels
                - Nothing disrupting incoming Na+ ions in their movement towards their destination
            - Decreased Cm
            - Increased membrane resistance
            - Rapid conduction
            - Charges "jump" to the next node
                - The jumping itself is saltatory conduction
- Axon membrane capacitance
    - **Membrane capacitance:**
        - The capability of storing a charge within the membrane
    - Without myelin:
        - More cations are "tied up" along the inner surface
            - This is because more anions along the surface of the membrane will attract more cations
            - These cations get deflected or distracted
        - Less cations are available to depolarize other parts of the membrane
            - Results in slower action potentials and slower signaling
        - Higher membrane capacitance
            - This means more ions can be stored within the membrane
                - This is not necessarily a good thing for reliable and fast conduction. Can cause the ions to get pulled away or distracted
    - With myelin:
        - Less cations are "tied up" along the inner surface
            - Less anions on the surface of the membrane to attract them
        - More cations are available to depolarize other parts of the membrane
            - Results in faster action potentials and faster signaling
        - Lower membrane capacitance
            - This means less ions can be stored within the membrane
- Axon membrane resistance
    - Without myelin:
        - Lower membrane resistance
        - Higher transmembrane current
    - With myelin:
        - Higher membrane resistance
        - Lower transmembrane current
- [[Action Potential Conduction|Action potential conduction]] in the axon
    - **Orthodromic**
        - Action potential travels in one direction down the axon to the terminal
            - Usually after the axon hillock and to the axon terminus
        - Natural action potential
    - **Antidromic**
        - Action potential travels backwards along the axon
            - Can trigger backpropagation to dendrites
                - Goes from axon to the soma to the dendrites
        - This is not natural, only experimental
            - Flows back to the axon hillock because stimulus was planted in an unnatural area
        - Antidromic does not mean backpropagation.
            - Antidromic is an experimental thing that basically causes a backwards-flowing action potential back towards the axon hillock. Can trigger action potentials for the dendrites
    - Typical conduction velocity
        - Unmyelinated axon: 2m/s
        - Myelinated axon: 120m/s
    - Duration of the action potential = ~2ms
- [[Information Flow: Cajal's Neuron Doctrine]]
    - Neuron polarity
        - Directionality of information flow
            - Goes from dendrites to soma to axon hillock to axon to axon terminal
            - Pre-synaptic (upstream) vs post-synaptic (downstream) neurons
            - All relative to a given synapse
        - Dendrites
            - EPSPs and IPSPs
            - Passive signal conductance
                - This is basically graded potentials that occur because of synaptic potentials
        - Axon
            - Action potential
            - Active signal conductance
                - This is the action potential lol
        - Axon terminal
            - Synaptic transmission
                - From presynaptic neurons to postsynaptic neurons
        - **Backpropagation** is an exception to this rule
            - Active signal conductance (action potential) goes backwards in the dendrites
            - Retrograde transmission occurs through dendritic transmitters
