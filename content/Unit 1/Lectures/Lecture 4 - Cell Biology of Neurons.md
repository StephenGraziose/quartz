#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 1/25/23

# Notes:

- Cells have various structures that aid them in functioning properly
    - Neurons have very unique properties and functions:
	- They are excitable
		- Contain electrical activity
	- They have a unique morphology
	- They perform protein trafficking
		- [[Axonal transport]]
	- They contain unique structural proteins
- **Cell body**
    - Gene expression and protein synthesis
        - Occurs through a few locations, including:
            - Nucleus
            - Ribosomes
            - Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
                - Rough means that it has ribosomes located along the membrane
                    - Studded
                - Used for protein transport and partial modification
            - Golgi Apparatus
                - Used for protein and cargo packaging through certain modifications
                    - Protein glycosylation
                - Essentially an extension of the ER
                - Performs vesicle formation
                    - Creates lysosomes
                    - Creates secretory vesicles
        - **Transcription (mRNA synthesis)**
            - Occurs in the nucleus
            - This is the process where DNA is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA)
            - mRNA is trafficked out of the nuclear pores and travels into the cytoplasm
        - **Translation (Protein synthesis)**
            - Occurs in the ribosomes of the cell bodies, either in the cytoplasm or on the RER
                - Free ribosomes synthesize cytosolic (free) proteins
                    - Just chill out in the cytoplasm and do things
                - RER ribosomes synthesize membrane-associated proteins
                    - Proteins are destined to be membrane-bound and will be found in the plasma
                    - membrane (or another membrane within the cell)
            - mRNA and tRNA work together at the ribosome to generate amino acids, which are subsequently linked together and form polypeptides
                - You remember this shit from genetics
            - After polypeptide synthesis concludes, the protein is trafficked into its final location
    - [[Proteins|Protein classes]]
        - **Cytosolic proteins**
            - Created by free ribosomes
            - Two types:
                - **Fibrillar proteins**
                    - Used in the cytoskeleton
                    - Provides structural support
                    - Actin, myosin
                    - Creates the morphology of the neurons too
                        - Dendritic spines and the shape of the dendrites, etc.
                - **Enzymes**
                    - Metabolic triggers
                    - Are basically biological catalysts for chemical reactions
                        - Proteins that essentially do shit
                    - Ex: Phosphorylate and dephosphorylate shit
        - **Nuclear and mitochondrial proteins**
            - Translocated to the nucleus/mitochondria
                - Ex: Transcription factors, DNA polymerase, RNA polymerase, etc.
        - Membrane-associated proteins
            - Synthesized by RER-associated ribosomes
            - Three types:
                - **Membrane-attached proteins**
                    - **Integral proteins**
                        - Embedded within the membrane
                            - Span the length of the plasma membrane
                        - Are **amphipathic**
                            - Semi polar semi nonpolar (# make sure this is accurate)
                        - Ex: Ion channel, carrier protein
                    - [[Proteins|Peripheral proteins]]
                        - Bound to integral proteins and are on one specific end of the plasma membrane
                        - Ex: Receptor proteins, G-protein in a GPCR,
                - **ER proteins**
                    - Proteins present in the ER required for basic ER functions
                        - Ex: Calcium ion channels
                            - Remember that the smooth ER is responsible for the storage of calcium ions
                        - Will be deposited into the ER membrane and just chill there
                - **Proteins contained within vesicles and lysosomes**
                    - Ex: **Secretory products, enzymes**
- Dendrites and Axons
    - Dendritic/Axonal projections
        - Occurs over very long distances
            - Some of your neurons are some of the longest cells of the body due to these projections
        - Protein transport mechanisms are required for molecules to travel these distances
            - Western Blots and other mechanisms are used to study protein transport to figure out how specific proteins operate and move around in neurons
    - [[Cytoskeleton]]
        - Comprised of 3 specific fibrillar proteins:
            - **Microtubules**
                - Comprised of **tubulin**
                - Create a nice straight pathway to formulate a highway for proteins to travel across
                - Dynamic instability
            - **Neurofilaments**
                - Comprised of **cytokeratins**
                - Intermediate in diameter
            - **Microfilaments**
                - Comprised of **actin**
                - Scattered throughout
                - Dynamic instability
    - [[Axonal Transport]]
        - Axonal transport has 3 different forms, and is responsible for protein transport along the axons:
            - **Fast Anterograde Axonal Transport:**
                - Synaptic vesicles and secretory granules use this to reach the axon terminals
                    - Essential for neurotransmitter operation
                - ATP dependent
                    - This is a format of active transport
                    - ATP powers this transport
                - **Kinesin** is a motor protein involved in this process
                    - Kinesin uses ATP to essentially "walk" across the microtubules
                    - Kinesin can travel across microtubules about~400mm/day
                - Moves from cell body to axon terminal
            - **Retrograde Axonal Transport:**
                - Degradation/recycling of proteins back into the cell body
                - Basically the opposite of anterograde axonal transport
                - Moves from axon terminal to cell body
                - **Dynein** is a motor protein involved in this process
                - Fast as well, but not as fast as fast anterograde axonal transport
                    - Dynein moves about 2/3rd of the speed along the microtubules as kinesin does
                - This is a format of active transport too
                    - Dynein requires ATP to function
            - **Slow Axoplasmic Flow (Anterograde):**
                - Cytosolic proteins (enzymes, cytoskeleton)
                - Passive transport through the cytoplasm
                    - Flow of molecules down their concentration gradients
                        - It is anterograde because there are more proteins in the cell body than the axon terminals usually
                        - Goes from cell body to axon terminal
                - Very slow
                    - 0.2mm - 0.5mm of travel/day
- Cellular Energy
    - **Cellular respiration**
        - This is the process for the formation of **ATP**
            - ATP is a major cellular energy source
                - Used for many cellular processes:
                    - Phosphorylation of proteins (kinase activity)
                        - Adding phosphate groups to proteins
                    - Dephosphorylation of proteins (phosphatase activity)
                        - Removing phosphate groups from proteins
            - Occurs within the mitochondria
                - The mitochondria is the US Stock Exchange of the cell
- [[Exocytosis and Endocytosis#Exocytosis|Exocytosis]]
    - Vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane
        - This is a format of active transport too
        - Secretion of proteins in vesicle lumen into the extracellular space
            - Stuff goes from inside of the cell to outside of the cell
        - This is a form of chemical transmission
        - **Insertion of vesicle membrane proteins into the plasma membrane**
            - Ex: Receptors
            - This can occur within the dendritic spines or the axon terminal
        - This is the basis of neurotransmitter activity
    - Golgi apparatus generates the vesicles required for this process to occur
- [[Exocytosis and Endocytosis#Endocytosis|Endocytosis]]
    - Vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane too
        - Also another format of active transport
    - Cellular uptake of molecules through vesicles
        - Occurs through rather specific procedures
    - Another essential aspect of cellular transport for proteins and other molecules
