# Notes:

- Why are we learning about resting membrane potential?
    - Ions are unevenly distributed between the inside and outside of the cell
    - The cell membrane is not equally permeable to all ions
    - The cell membrane has an electric potential at rest due to how cellular ion flow works
- [[Resting Membrane Potential|Neuronal Membrane Potential]]
    - The membrane is polarized at rest
        - Positive and negative poles exist across the membrane
        - The intracellular environments of neurons are more negatively charged than the extracellular environments of neurons
            - Cytosol is negatively charged
            - ECM is positively charged
        - Membrane potential = $V_{m}$
            - $V_{m}$ = Vinside - Voutside
            - $V_{m}$= -50mV to -70mV
                - Varies based on organism and cell type, but usually will be referred to as -65mV
    - **Electrical potential (V)**
        - Measured in voltage
            - Voltage is measured in millivolts for neurons (mV)
        - Electrical potential is essentially the potential to generate an electrical current
            - The plasma membrane is equivalent to a battery
            - If you were to open up a bridge between the intracellular and extracellular space, ions would flow between these spaces
- Ion movement
    - Two forces in particular are acting on ions to control ion movement:
        - **Chemical forces**
            - Flow down chemical concentration gradients
        - **Electrical forces**
            - Like charges repel
            - Opposite charges attract
            - Electrostatic interactions
    - These forces can overcome each other based on their strengths
    - **Electrical current (I)**
        - Movement of charge
        - Measured in milliamperes in neurons and cells (mA)
        - The current direction = The direction of the flow of positive charge
- [[Membrane Signals]]
    - **Resting potential**
        - The cell membrane at rest
        - Cells are normally just polarized at rest
        - The leak channels do not form this, they instead just maintain it
        - This is actually formed by chemical and electrostatic forces
        - ~-65mV
    - **Hyperpolarization**
        - *Outward* current
        - An increase in negative charge (makes the intracellular and extracellular space even more polarized)
            - Moving positive charges outside of the cell
            - Moving negative charges into the cell
    - **Depolarization**
        - *Inward* current
        - An increase in positive charge (makes the intracellular and extracellular space less polarized)
            - Moving positive charges into the cell
            - Moving negative charges outside of the cell
    - **Graded Potentials (Passive Potentials)**
        - Proportionate to input
            - However many ions go in or out affects the strength and size of the graded potential
        - Passively propagated
        - Caused by ions channels and general ion transport
        - Graded means that the size can change and vary based on how many ions are making the movement
    - **Action Potentials**
        - All or nothing
            - Summation of graded potentials at the axon hillock
        - Same size, same shape
- Ion concentration gradients
    - Membrane potential due to different intracellular and extracellular ion concentrations
    - There are different concentrations of ions in cells:
        - **Na+**
            - Higher concentration outside the cell
            - Inward flow
        - **Cl-**
            - Higher concentration outside the cell
            - Inward flow
        - **K+**
            - Higher concentration inside of the cell
            - Outward flow
        - **Ca2+**
            - MUCH higher concentration outside the cell
            - Very low inside of the cell
            - Inward flow
    - Neurons are salty bananas
    - Ions do not always follow their concentration gradients due to the fact that they face electrostatic forces too
    - $[K+]_{inside}$ > $[K+]_{outside}$ :
        - $K^+$ pumped into neurons
        - Extracellular K+ uptake by astrocytes
    - $[Na^+]_{inside}$ < $[Na^+]_{outside}$ :
        - $Na^+$ pumped out of neurons
    - Low [Cl-]inside:
        - Cl- pumped out of neurons
    - Low [Ca2+]inside:
        - Ca2+ stored in the smooth ER
- The reason why the intracellular space is so negatively charged even though there is tons of chloride outside of the cell is due to the fact that there are many large anions inside of the cell
    - Include proteins and other molecules
- Leak currents
    - Potassium leak channels:
        - Permeability to K+
            - Potassium diffusion is OUTWARDS
            - Leak current --> K+ outwards --> outward ionic current (IK)
                - IK = Potassium current (format is used for other currents too)
        - Redistribution of charge
            - Creates a negative electrical potential
            - Creates a negative electrical gradient
    - Astrocytes only have K+ leak channels in their membranes
- Ion Equilibrium Potential
    - An ion is at equilibrium when:
        - **Electrical gradient = Chemical gradient**
            - This is expressed by the **Nernst Equation**
                - Remember this motherfucker?
                    - $$E = \frac{RT}{ZF}(\ln\frac{[Ion]_{outside}}{[Ion_{inside}]})$$
                        - E = Equilibrium potential
                            - Electrical force that is acting on the ion to overcome the concentration gradient
                        - R = Gas constant
                        - T = Temperature
                        - F = Faraday's constant
                        - Z = Ion charge
                            - Chloride is -1
                    - Log(1) = 0
                    - Log(<1) = negative
                        - Need a negative intracellular environment to overcome concentration gradient
                    - Log(>1) = positive
                        - Need a positive intracellular environment to overcome concentration gradient
    - Equilibrium means that the electrical potential exactly balances against the concentration gradient of the ion
    - **Nernst Potential** = Ion Equilibrium Potential
- Chloride ions do not have much electrostatic driving potential because its equilibrium potential (-65mV) is approximately equal to the resting membrane potential (also about -65mV)
- Average ion equilibrium potentials:
    - $E_{K}$ ~= -80mV to -90mV
        - Potassium ions want to leave the cell. To avoid this, the cell needs a strong negative charge to pull them back inwards
    - $E_{Na}$ =~ +60mV to +65mV
        - Sodium ions want to enter the cell. To avoid this, the cell needs a strong-ish positive charge to repel them back outwards
    - $E_{Cl}$ ~= -65mV to -70mV
        - Eh, almost the exact same as the resting membrane potential of the neuron
    - $E_{Ca}$ ~= +250mV
        - Calcium ions want to enter the cell. To avoid this, the cell needs a super strong positive charge to repel them back outwards
