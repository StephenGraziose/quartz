# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 2/6/23

# Notes:

- [[Voltage-Gated Channels]]
    - Responsible for action potential generation
    - Have a voltage sensor
        - Essentially a chain of amino acids with positive charges within the cell membrane
            - When cell membrane depolarizes (becomes more positively-charged), the positive charges are repelled away from the inside of the cell, triggering the channel to undergo a conformational change
    - Are sensitive to depolarization
        - See example above
- Voltage-Gated K+ Channel
    - K+ channel has a singular gate
        - Referred to as the **activation gate**
    - Activation/Deactivation
        - There is no inactivation, just deactivating
            - The K+ channel is non-inactivating
                - The K+ channel does close though! It just activates and then deactivates
                    - Opens, then closes activation gate
                        - Very simple
- Voltage-Gated Na+ Channel
    - Na+ channel has two molecular gates
        - **Activation gate ("m" gate)**
            - Voltage sensor domain
            - Located on inside of the cell
        - **Inactivation gate ("h" gate)**
            - Contains a voltage-sensitive ball and chain
            - Slowly closes
            - Located on outside of the cell
    - Both the activation and the inactivation gates are voltage-sensitive
        - Both respond to depolarization
        - They both respond in opposite ways
            - When the membrane depolarizes, the activation gate opens up
            - When the membrane repolarizes, the inactivation gate closes up and blocks the pore
    - Activation gate starts closed, has a rapid opening
    - Inactivation gate starts open, has a slow closing
    - **Activation/deactivation:**
        - Opening/closing of the activation gate
    - **Inactivation/deinactivation:**
        - Closing/reopening of inactivation gate
- The K+ channel moves and acts slower than the Na+ channel
- Events
    - Membrane is depolarized to -55mV
        - Triggers the activation gates for Na+ and K+ at the same time
            - Na+ gets activated first due to being faster as a mechanism
                - Na+ rushes in
                - K+ gets activated a little later due to being slower as a mechanism
                    - K+ rushes out
                    - Na+ inactivation begins, takes a bit though
                    - Membrane voltage drops slightly due to K+ rushing out
                        - Na+ channel inactivates first, K+ channel eventually deactivates once voltage drops sufficiently enough
                            - Na+ channel deactivates and eventually deinactivates
                            - Afterhyperpolarization is corrected through active transport (Na+/K+ pump)
    - **Make sure that this sequence of events is correct and not wrong!**
- Summary:
    - Na+ --> activation gate, inactivation gate
    - K+ --> activation gate
