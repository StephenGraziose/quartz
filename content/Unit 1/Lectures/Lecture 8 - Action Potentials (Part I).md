# Notes:

- Why are we learning about the action potential?
    - Action potentials propagate information through the nervous system
    - They are essentially electrical messages that pass through neurons
- Recording Membrane Potential
    - **Current-Clamp Recordings** record membrane voltage (NOT CURRENT)
        - Elicit changes in membrane potential with an injection of current into a neuron
            - Ohm's Law: $V = IR$
                - Voltage = Current X Resistance
                - Changing around variables can cause different effects on voltage
                    - Resistance will be a constant here
            - If the injected current does not depolarize the membrane to threshold, no action potential will occur
            - If injected current depolarizes the membrane beyond the threshold, action potentials will occur
        - Positive current (+): Depolarization
            - **Suprathreshold**: Action potential generation occurs
                - Literally meaning above the threshold
            - Action potentials are all-or-none signals
                - Axon hillock is the reason for this
            - These are inward currents due to being positive
        - Negative current (-): Hyperpolarization
            - Goes even more below threshold
                - Membrane potential is even more negative than before
                    - This blocks the possibility for action potentials to form
            - These are outward currents due to being negative
        - Frequency coding
            - Increased magnitude of input --> Increased frequency
            - Increased duration of input --> Increased duration of the spike train
                - This just means constant occurring action potentials
                    - The spike is just the big action potential
                - There is a refractory period between each action potential
            - The spike itself will be the same height always. The voltage of the action potential's spike cannot be changed
- Recording Membrane Currents
    - **Voltage-Clamp Recordings** record membrane currents (NOT VOLTAGE)
        - Clamp of membrane voltage by current injection
    - If Vm != Vcommand [or Vc], then feedback current injection to correct the membrane voltage
    - The feedback current = The membrane current
- [[The Action Potential]]
    - **Part 1: Resting Potential**
        - Normal resting membrane potential
        - Cell is at rest
    - **Part 1.5: Threshold Breach**
        - Graded potentials occur that eventually depolarize the membrane beyond the threshold
        - Caused by either leaky or ligand-gated Na+ ion channels
    - **Part 2: Rising Phase**
        - Rapid depolarization
            - Occurs when voltage-gated Na+ ion channels open up once the threshold is crossed, resulting in Na+ ions rushing into the neuron
                - This causes the cell to rapidly depolarize
                - These Na+ channels have become activated
    - **Part 3: Overshoot**
        - Membrane becomes so positive due to Na+ rushing in
        - Top of the spike
        - Voltage-gated Na+ ion channels inactivate at this point
            - Na+ stops flowing in
            - Ball blocks the pore
    - **Part 4: Falling Phase**
        - Occurs when the voltage-gated Na+ ion channels close once the overshoot occurs
        - Voltage-gated K+ ion channels open up (activate)
            - K+ starts flowing out
        - Membrane potential begins to hyperpolarize
            - Starts to become negative
    - **Part 5: Undershoot**
        - "Afterhyperpolarization" following the big spike
        - This is due to K+ efflux and the K+ channel having a delay when it deactivates
        - Corrective changes in the cell membrane potential result in a return to the resting membrane potential
            - AKA, stuff like Na+/K+ pump and leak channels and whatnot
- Action Potential Currents
    - Suprathreshold step in voltage causes:
        - A combined inward and outward current
            - Inward current:
                - Generated by voltage-gated Na+ channels
                    - Voltage-sensitive (evoked by depolarization)
                - Blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX)
                    - Exposure causes no action potentials to occur due to voltage-gated Na+ channels being blocked
                        - No possible way to further depolarize the membrane and cause the overshoot and spike tip
                - Inactivating at some point
            - Outward current:
                - Generated by voltage-gated K+ channels
                    - Voltage-sensitive (evoked by depolarization)
                - Blocked by tetraethylammonium (TEA)
                    - Exposure causes permanent action potentials to occur due to voltage-gated K+ channels being blocked
                        - Permanent, in the way there is no hyperpolarization of the membrane
                - Non-inactivating
    - In the graph, the downward curve means inward current (influx of positive charge)
        - The upward curve means outward current (influx of negative charge {or efflux of positive charge})
        - This is due to how the current-clamp recording technique involves injecting an opposite current to that of the cell
            - Kinda odd
    - Action potentials have an inward current first, than an outward current afterwards
        - Inward Na+ current first, outward K+ current afterwards
- Positive Na+ Feedback/Negative K+ Feedback
    - Fast positive cycle:
        - 1. Membrane depolarizes
        - 2. Voltage-gated Na+ channels are activated
        - 3. Increase Na+ influx
        - 4. Membrane is further depolarized
            - If subthreshold, **the feedback loop is not entered**
            - If suprathreshold, **a positive feedback loop is entered**
        - Enter the slow negative cycle now!
    - Slow negative cycle:
        - 5. Voltage-gated K+ channels are activated
        - 6. Increase K+ efflux
        - 7. Membrane is hyperpolarized
            - Feedback loop is exited here
