During [[The Action Potential|action potentials,]] there is active signaling occurring along the axon, and a series of processes occur along the axonal membrane.

### Initial Conduction

During the initial conduction of the action potential, there is a combination of graded potentials and active signaling along the axon. 

There is a passive spread of cations down the axoplasm, and graded potentials are occurring due to the ion channels on the axon membrane, causing deplolarization.

Once the neuron is sufficiently depolarized, the action potential occurs
- Regeneration of action potential occurs across the axon
	- The membrane experiencing the refractory period will be located upstream of the axon during the action potential
		- This prevents any possible back propagation during the middle of an action potential event
- If we stimulated an axon in its center experimentally, it would cause the spread of an action potential in both directions
	- This is because there was no previous refractory period occurring in either direction of the start site


### Factors influencing conduction velocity
- **Axonal diameter**
	- Larger diameter axons have faster conduction velocity
		- More lanes on a highway
	- Smaller diameter axons have slower conduction velocity
- **Myelin**
	- Myelin speeds up conduction velocity due to insulating the axon and causing a process known as **saltatory conduction** to occur
- **Saltatory conduction**
	- Only occurs in myelinated axons
	- [[Glia#Schwann Cells|Schwann Cells]] in PNS myelinate
	- [[Glia#Oligodendrocytes|Oligodendrocytes]] in CNS myelinate
	- Myelinated axons contain distinct components:
		- **Nodes of Ranvier**
			- Gaps between the myelin sheath
			- Super high Na+ channel density
			- Increased membrane capacitance (Cm)
			- Decreased membrane resistance
			- Conduction slows
				- Replenishing Na+ ions
		- **Internodes**
			- The chunky myelin bits between the nodes of Ranvier
			- Fewer Na+ channels
				- Nothing disrupting incoming Na+ ions in their movement towards their destination
			- Decreased Cm
			- Increased membrane resistance
			- Rapid conduction
			- Charges "jump" to the next node
				- The jumping itself is saltatory conduction

### Axon Membrane Capacitance
- **Membrane capacitance:**
	- The capability of storing a charge within the membrane
	- **Without myelin:**
		- More cations are "tied up" along the inner surface
			- This is because more anions along the surface of the membrane will attract more cations
			- These cations get deflected or distracted
		- Less cations are available to depolarize other parts of the membrane
			- Results in slower action potentials and slower signaling
		- **Higher membrane capacitance**
			- This means more ions can be stored within the membrane
				- This is not necessarily a good thing for reliable and fast conduction. Can cause the ions to get pulled away or distracted
	- **With myelin:**
		- Less cations are "tied up" along the inner surface
			- Less anions on the surface of the membrane to attract them
		- More cations are available to depolarize other parts of the membrane
			- Results in faster action potentials and faster signaling
		- **Lower membrane capacitance**
			- This means less ions can be stored within the membrane

### Axon Membrane Resistance
- **Membrane resistance:**
	- The ability for a membrane to retain a charge and prevent ions from leaking out
	- **Without myelin:**
		- Lower membrane resistance
		- Higher transmembrane current
	- **With myelin:**
	        - Higher membrane resistance
	        - Lower transmembrane current
