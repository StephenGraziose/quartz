The action potential is the cornerstone of nervous system communication, in which a message is transmitted along the axon of a neuron.

### Steps of the Action Potential

**Part 1: Resting Potential**
- Normal resting [[Resting Membrane Potential]]
	- Cell is at rest

**Part 1.5: Threshold Breach**
- Graded potentials occur that eventually depolarize the membrane beyond the threshold
	- Caused by either leaky or ligand-gated Na+ ion channels

**Part 2: Rising Phase**
- Rapid depolarization
	- Occurs when [[Voltage-Gated Channels#Voltage-Gated $ ce{Na+}$ Channel|voltage-gated Na+ ion channels]] open up once the threshold is crossed, resulting in Na+ ions rushing into the neuron
		- This causes the cell to rapidly depolarize
		- These Na+ channels have become activated

**Part 3: Overshoot**
- Membrane becomes so positive due to Na+ rushing in
	- Top of the spike
	- Voltage-gated Na+ ion channels inactivate at this point
		- Na+ stops flowing in
		- Ball blocks the pore

**Part 4: Falling Phase**
- Occurs when the voltage-gated Na+ ion channels close once the overshoot occurs
	- [[Voltage-Gated Channels#Voltage-Gated $ ce{K+}$ Channel|Voltage-gated K+ ion channels]] open up (activate)
		- K+ starts flowing out
	- Membrane potential begins to hyperpolarize
		- Starts to become negative

**Part 5: Undershoot**
- "Afterhyperpolarization" following the big spike
	- This is due to K+ efflux and the K+ channel having a delay when it deactivates
	- Corrective changes in the cell membrane potential result in a return to the resting membrane potential
		- AKA, stuff like Na+/K+ pump and leak channels and whatnot

### Refractory Period

There are times during the action potential during which it is either impossible, or very hard, to trigger a subsequent action potential. These are known as **refractory periods.**

**Absolute refractory period**
- The inactivation of Na+ channels
- Immediately after the spike
	- Literally causes the inactivation gate to close up (ball begins to block the pore)
		- Waiting period happens for the Na+ channel to fully deinactivate
			- The ball finally stops blocking the pore
	- **IMPOSSIBLE** **to overcome**
    - **Relative refractory period**
	- The afterhyperpolarization event that occurs after the action potential
	- Corrected by active transport of Na+ and K+
	- **POSSIBLE** **to overcome** if an applied stimulus is strong enough
	- Na+ channel finally *deinactivates*
