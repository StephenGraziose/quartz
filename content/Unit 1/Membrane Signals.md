There are a few types of membrane signals that occur as a result of the change in membrane potential:

### Resting potential

- The cell membrane at rest
	- Cells are normally just polarized at rest
	- The [[Ion Channels#Leak Channels|leak channels]] do not form this, they instead just maintain it
	- This is actually formed by chemical and electrostatic forces
	- [[Resting membrane potential]] is ~-65mV

### Changes in Current Direction

**Hyperpolarization**
- *Outward* current
- An increase in *negative* *charge* (makes the intracellular and extracellular space even more polarized)
	- Moving positive charges outside of the cell
	- Moving negative charges into the cell

**Depolarization**
- *Inward* current
- An increase in *positive* *charge* (makes the intracellular and extracellular space less polarized)
	- Moving positive charges into the cell
	- Moving negative charges outside of the cell

### Graded vs Action Potentials

**Graded Potentials (Passive Potentials)**
- Proportionate to input
	- However many ions go in or out affects the strength and size of the graded potential
- *Passively* propagated
- Caused by ions channels and general ion transport
- Graded means that the size can change and vary based on how many ions are making the movement

[[The Action Potential|Action Potentials]]
- All or nothing
	- Summation of graded potentials at the [[Neurons#Axon Hillock|axon hillock]]
		- Suprathreshold
	- Same size, same shape
- *Actively* propagated

All of these changes are as a result of [[Ion Concentration Gradients|ion concentration gradients.]]
