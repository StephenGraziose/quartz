As mentioned [[Ion Channels#Voltage-Gated Ion Channels|before,]] voltage-gated ion channels are dependent on the membrane potential of the neuron. To achieve this, they have a voltage sensor (which is in the form of several positively-charged amino acids within the cell membrane).

There are several vital voltage-gated channels within neurons:

### Voltage-Gated K+ Channel
- The **voltage-gated K+ channel** has a singular gate
	- Referred to as the **activation gate**
    - Activation/Deactivation
	- There is no inactivation, just deactivating
		- The K+ channel is non-inactivating
			- The K+ channel does close though! It just activates and then deactivates
				- Opens, then closes activation gate
					- Very simple

### Voltage-Gated Na+ Channel
- The **voltage-gated Na+ channel** has two molecular gates
	- **Activation gate ("m" gate)**
		- Voltage sensor domain
		- Located on inside of the cell
	- **Inactivation gate ("h" gate)**
		- Contains a voltage-sensitive ball and chain
		- Slowly closes
		- Located on outside of the cell
	- Both the activation and the inactivation gates are voltage-sensitive
	- Both respond to depolarization
	- They both respond in opposite ways
		- When the membrane depolarizes, the activation gate opens up
		- When the membrane repolarizes, the inactivation gate closes up and blocks the pore
	- Activation gate starts closed, has a rapid opening
	- Inactivation gate starts open, has a slow closing
	- **Activation/deactivation:**
		- Opening/closing of the *activation gate*
	- **Inactivation/deinactivation:**
		- Closing/reopening of *inactivation gate*

### [[The Action Potential|Action Potential]] Events With Na+ and K+ Channels
- Events:
	- Membrane is depolarized to -55mV
		- Triggers the activation gates for Na+ and K+ at the same time
			- **Na+ gets activated first due to being faster as a mechanism**
				- Na+ rushes in
				- **K+ gets activated a little later due to being slower as a mechanism**
					- K+ rushes out
					- Na+ inactivation begins, takes a bit though
					- Membrane voltage drops slightly due to K+ rushing out
						- Na+ channel inactivates first, K+ channel eventually deactivates once voltage drops sufficiently enough
							- Na+ channel deactivates and eventually deinactivates
							- Afterhyperpolarization is corrected through active transport (Na+/K+ pump)

### Voltage-Gated Ca2+ Channel
- The **voltage-gated Ca2+ channel** is not involved in creating or propagating an action potential, but is instead involved in the release of [[neurotransmitters]] from the presynaptic neuron.
- The molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter release is not directly voltage-dependent
	- However, VGCCs are responsible for allowing Ca2+ to enter the axon terminals
	- Neurotransmitter release is caused by an increase in Ca2+ concentration within the terminal
		- Essentially, neurotransmitter release is Ca2+ dependent
