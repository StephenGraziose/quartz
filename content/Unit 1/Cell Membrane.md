The **plasma membrane** of the cell is an important cellular feature that separates the inside and the outside of the cell. It also contains structures that regulate the transport of molecules inside and outside of the cell. Some of these structures include:

### Phospholipid Bilayer
- **Phospholipid**
	- Chains of fatty acids that contain phosphate heads
		- Have polar heads and nonpolar tails
			- This makes them **amphipathic**
				- Essentially semi-polar
					- **Hydrophobic (nonpolar) and hydrophilic (polar)** at the same time (different portions of the molecule)
 - **Bilayer**
	 - Two sheets
		- Hydrophobic tails face each other
			- Form the inner center of the cell membrane
		- Hydrophilic heads face away from each other
			- Are on the inner and outer faces of the cell membrane
		- Impermeable to large molecules, polar molecules, and/or ions
	- The phospholipid bilayer is like a fluid mosaic
		- Fluid mosaic model yaddah yaddah
		- Membrane proteins are freely floating and moving around
	- Membrane proteins
		- Integral membrane proteins include:
			- Ion channels
			- Ion pumps and transporters
		- Peripheral membrane proteins include:
			- Proteins associated with ion channels and ion pumps and transporters

### Cholesterol
- Stabilizes membrane fluidity at all times
	- Helps create a proper environment for membrane proteins and keeps the cell membrane functioning

- ### Carbohydrates
- **Glycolipids**
	- Form interactions with the extracellular matrix
	- Combination of carbohydrates and lipids
- **Glycoproteins**
	- Form protein-protein interactions
	- Essential towards cell signaling and communication
	- Combination of carbohydrates and proteins

- ### Integral Membrane Proteins
- **Extracellular Domain**
	- Form interactions with the environment
	- Ex: Receptor binding sites
- **Intracellular Domain**
	- Responsible for intracellular signaling
	- Form interactions with the cytoskeleton
		- Anchoring the channel where it needs to be or signaling the structure of the neuron
	- Also the part where certain things attach
		- Ex: G protein of the GPCR
- **Fluid Mosaic Model**
	- Lipids and proteins are freely "floating" in the membrane
	- Microfilaments are responsible for protein anchoring and migration
	- Cholesterol is responsible for maintaining the fluidity of the cell membrane
