For the CNS, the major [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]] involved for EPSP generation is **glutamate**.

### Glutamate
- Excitatory amino acid
- Synthesis occurs in the terminal
	- Precursor is **glutamine**
	- Synthesis is catalyzed by **glutaminase**
	- Loaded into vesicles by **vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT)**
- Release
	- Postsynaptic receptors
		- [[Ionotropic Receptors|Ionotropic]] (AMPA, Kainate, NMDA)
		- [[Metabotropic Receptors|Metabotropic]] (mGluR1-8)
- Reuptake
	- This is the termination of glutamate actions
	- Glutamate transporters on membranes of astrocytes and neurons (EAATs)
		- Reconversion to glutamine by **glutamine synthetase** in astrocytes
- Glutamine transfer from astrocytes to neuron axon terminals occurs through glutamine transporters
	- Repackaging and recycling via vesicular glutamate transporters

Glutamate receptors are selective towards Na+, K+, and sometimes Ca2+ too!

There are both **ionotropic glutamate receptors** and **metabotropic glutamate receptors**:

### Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors

There are three different types of ionotropic glutamate receptors:

#### AMPA Receptors
- Na+/K+ permeable
	- Similar to [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors#Nicotinic Receptors (nAChRs)|nicotinic ACh receptors]]
		- Purely ligand sensitive and causes K+ efflux and Na+ influx to occur, and Na+ influx dominates, causing depolarization
- AMPA receptors are responsible for **EPSP/EPSC Reversals**
	- This occurs through the recruitment of **afferent axons**
		- Afferent axons are axons projecting away from the intended location
        - This increases stimulus intensity
	- This increases EPSP amplitude
- **Reversal Potential**
	- Mixed Na+/K+ current
	- $V_{reversal} = 0mV$
	- Similar to [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors#Nicotinic Receptors (nAChRs)|nicotinic ACh receptors]]
#### Kainate Receptors
- Na+/K+ permeable
	- Similar to [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors#Nicotinic Receptors (nAChRs)|nicotinic ACh receptors]]
		- Purely ligand sensitive

>AMPA and Kainate receptors are almost purely identical to each other in structure. The only real difference is that AMPA receptors also do EPSP reversal. NMDA is very different from those two, however!

#### NMDA Receptors
- Na+, K+, AND Ca2+ permeable
	- Ligand-gated AND voltage-sensitive
		- Mg2+ binding site within the pore
			- Basically blocks the pore
			- Bit like the ball and chain model for the voltage-gated Na+ channel
	- Depolarization induces an unblock in the channel
- Other modularity sites (sites for binding within these channels):
	- All antagonists here are binding to the allosteric site of the receptor
	- Glycine/serine = Co-agonists
	- Zn2+ = Antagonist
	- PCP = Antagonist
	- Ketamine = Antagonist
	- Antagonists here are gonna cause you to dissociate and trip fucking BALLS because they're blocking excitatory potentials and shit
- The currents for these NMDA receptors is weirdly budding downwards then spikes upwards
	- This budding, then spike, is because of the fact that at more hyperpolarized membrane voltages, there would be more NMDA receptors with Mg2+ blocking the pore
		- This results in significantly less current occurring
		- Depolarization eventually causes the Mg2+ ion to fuck off and for current to kick into positive gear
	- Different from AMPA and Kainate currents
		- These currents go up in almost an exponential growth model
		- Remember that these two are like almost the same thing
	- Reversal potential is the x-intercept of the graph for this receptor current graph
	- Check the slide to see what this is referring to
- **Mixed AMPA/NMDA Receptors**
	- This is basically an AMPA and NMDA receptor acting as a pair together
		- Glutamate binds to AMPA receptors, causes inward current
			- Forms an EPSP, which then can be a *sufficient enough depolarization event to cause the Mg2+ ion to fuck off from the NMDA receptor, which then causes further depolarization* because Na+ and Ca2+ can enter the cell through the NMDA receptor
			- This causes big big EPSP occurring

- **NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**
	- Depolarization via AMPA receptor activation causes expulsion of Mg2+ block from NMDA receptor pore
	- Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors leads to **long-term potentiation (LTP)**
		- LTP is the increased response of a synapse which causes a stronger synapse
		- Related to a memory circuit
			- Related to synaptic plasticity, synaptic growth, etc.
		- Can increase opening rate, extend opening time, etc.
			- Causes enhanced responses overall
	- Can cause the proliferation of NMDA and AMPA receptors within the postsynaptic dendrite

### Metabotropic Glutamate Receptors

- mGluRs will trigger a second-messenger cascade when glutamate binds to them, causing *either hyperpolarization or depolarization of the postsynaptic cell*
	- It really depends on the receptor.
	- It all has something to do with K+ and Na+ though!
