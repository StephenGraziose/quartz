**The Neuromuscular Junction** consists of many specialized synapses at the motor endplate, and involve [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors|acetylcholine.]]

### The Neuromuscular Junction (NMJ)
- These are specialized synapses at the motor endplate
	- Nerve-muscle synapses for motor neurons
	- Design of the NMJ
	- Axon terminals of presynaptic motor neuron are in the form of multiple **boutons**
		- Boutons contain **active zones**
			- Contain docking and fusion proteins for vesicles
			- Contain mitochondria (energy stores)
			- Contain synaptic vesicles (contain acetylcholine)
	- **Post-synaptic muscle fiber**
		- Contain **junctional folds**
			- Increase the reliability of transmission by localization of acetylcholine receptors to the crests of the folds
			- Enhances the effect of depolarization by localization of sodium channels in the troughs
			- Essentially just like the cristae in the mitochondria, increases the amount of surface area for ion channels
		- Contain **Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors**
			- Remember that these are **ionotropic**
				- Activation causes an action potential in muscle fibers
					- Remember that muscle cells are electrically excitable
	- **Basement Membrane**
		- Contains an enzyme known as **acetylcholinesterase**
			- This enzyme breaks down ACh into choline and acetate
- **Endplate Potentials (EPPs)**
	- These are the *EPSPs of the neuromuscular junction*
- **EPP Reversal Potential**
	- This is the membrane voltage at which **endplate current (EPC)** <u>reverses</u> in its direction
		- $I_{Na} = I_{K}$
			- Or, $I_{in} = I_{out}$
	- The voltage for reverse potential = 0mV
		- $V_{rev} = 0mV$
	- Single channel currents here parallel whole-cell currents, except for the fact that they're square in shape
		- Meaning, all-or-none
	- Whole cell currents produce EPPs
	- The direction and amplitude of the current is the sum of its constituent ionic currents
		- Constituent ionic current is a function of the **driving force** on each of the ions involved
