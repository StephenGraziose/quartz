**Quantum:**
- 1 packet of neurotransmitter (1 vesicle)
	- This causes a unitary response
		- Either you secrete 1 vesicle, 2 vesicles, 3 vesicles, etc.
			- Cannot release a fraction of a vesicle
			- The unit involved is a **quantum**
		- Each vesicle has about the same amount of neurotransmitter packed in them
**Spontaneous Postsynaptic Potential**
- 1 unit is released only
- This is like a miniature potential
	- Spontaneous, as in no action potential caused this to occur
		- Caused by maybe some extra Ca2+ present in extracellular space
		- Not evoked by any message
**Evoked Postsynaptic Potential**
- An action potential caused this potential to occur
	- Neurotransmitter was intentionally released
		- Can be multiple vesicles released, can be one vesicle released
	- The amplitude of the formed PSP** **is the integral of multiple of mini postsynaptic potentials
- An experiment can be done to test quantum of PSPs:
	- Stimulate a motor axon, and record **endplate potentials (EPPs)** in the muscle fiber
		- Endplate potentials are the postsynaptic potentials between motor neurons and muscle fibers
			- Different terminology, but same concept as postsynaptic potentials
	- **Miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs)**
		- These are spontaneous endplate potentials
			- Like the name implies, they are quite small and occur randomly
