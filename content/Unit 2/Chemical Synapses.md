### Chemical Synapses
- Involve chemical transmitters known as [[Neurotransmitters]]
	- These bind to postsynaptic receptors on the postsynaptic neuron
- The chemical synapse is divided into four zones:
	- **Presynaptic region**
		- Neuron that releases neurotransmitter
	- **Active zone**
		- This is where exocytosis of vesicles containing neurotransmitters occurs
	- **Synaptic cleft**
		- This is space between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron where the neurotransmitters are released into
	- **Postsynaptic region**
		- Neuron who has neurotransmitters bind to their [[Ion Channels#Ligand-gated Ion Channels|ligand-gated ion channels]] in their [[Neurons|dendrites]] and experiences EPSPs or IPSPs

#### Chemical Synapse Types (Neuron Structures Involved)
- **Axodendritic synapses**
	- Very common type of synapse
	- Axon terminal of presynaptic cell and dendrite of postsynaptic cell
	- Communication can go to different areas of the dendrite:
		- **Dendritic shaft**
			- Usually inhibitory
			- Since the spines grow due to excitatory messages, the shaft becomes the de-facto area for inhibitory signals
		- **Dendritic spine**
			- Usually excitatory
			- Spines usually grow in response to excitation, so they've become the primary area for excitatory messages
	- Regulates postsynaptic excitability
	- Stimulates and inhibits action potential generation
- **Axosomatic synapses**
	- Axon terminal of presynaptic cell and soma of postsynaptic cell
	- Usually inhibitory
		- Same reason as dendritic shaft
			- If an excitatory message wanted to be sent, it would have gone to the spines
	- Regulates postsynaptic excitability
	- Stimulates and inhibits action potential generation
- **Axo-axonic synapses**
	- Axon terminal of presynaptic cell communicates with the axon terminal of a postsynaptic cell
		- "Ass to Ass"
	- Causes an increase or decrease in neurotransmitter release
		- Does this by regulating the probability of neurotransmitters being released
	- Reason why it doesn't regulate communication in the same way other synapses do is because if an excitatory or inhibitory message wanted to be sent, it would have been sent to dendrites or even soma
		- Action potential is gonna happen here no matter what, but these synapses help regulate the actual effect of the action potential
			- Changes the amount of positive or negative charge entering the nerve terminal, which affects the amount of neurotransmitter being released

#### Chemical Synapse Types (Excitatory vs Inhibitory)
- **Asymmetric synapses**
	- Excitatory
	- Neurotransmitter used here is [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors|glutamate]]
	- The shape is asymmetrical due to having so many glutamate receptors packed in this area
- **Symmetric synapses**
	- Inhibitory
	- Neurotransmitter used here is [[GABA and GABA Receptors|GABA]]
	- The shape is symmetrical due to having not that many GABA receptors in that area
