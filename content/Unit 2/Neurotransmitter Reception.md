- Receptor subtypes
	- There are multiple receptor subtypes for each neurotransmitter
		- Ex: Acetylcholine (ACh) (See below)
- **Receptor Agonists**
	- These are molecules that activate neurotransmitter receptors
		- Ex: Nicotine, muscarine, ACh
- **Receptor Antagonists**
	- These are molecules that block neurotransmitter receptors
		- Ex: Curare, atropine
- There are two mechanisms of antagonism:
	- **Competitive Antagonists**
		- Physically block the ligand-binding site
			- Can be overcome potentially if there are enough real neurotransmitters present
	- **Allosteric (Noncompetitive) Antagonists**
		- Bind to the allosteric site of the receptor, causing a conformational change that blocks the ligand-binding site
			- Cannot be overcome based on real neurotransmitter concentration
