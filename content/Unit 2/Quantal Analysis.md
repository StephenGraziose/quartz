**Endplate Potential Amplitude Histogram**
- Number of events that occur at each amplitude
	- Contain a polymodal distribution of peaks
		- This means multiple peaks
	- Histogram peaks are **integral multiples of unitary endplate potentials (MEPPs)**
		- Data tends to cluster around certain amplitudes that are integral multiples of each other
			- Ex: One quantum of NT causes a 0.5mV amplitude EPP, two quanta of NT causes a 1.0mV amplitude EPP, etc.
	- Overlap of peaks implies the same number of vesicles being released
		- A bit like integration in 1-HNMR
	- Recording these potentials from further away gives no results because of the fact that passive potentials dissipate over distance
		- If recording potentials from further away gave results, this would mean that an action potential is occurring due to the electric charge being actively propagated through the muscle cell
	- Anything on these readings of amplitude that have an "S" on them means spontaneous
	- These histograms **display the amplitude of EPPs (X-axis) and how many of them were observed (Y-Axis)**
- You're gonna want to know how to read/interpret/use one of these histograms for the test
	- The release of neurotransmitters is quantal
	- Meaning, in discrete and defined units

>As seen above, one quantum of neurotransmitter released causes a 0.4mV amplitude EPP. Two will cause an 0.8mV EPP, etc.
