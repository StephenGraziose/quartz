# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/1/23

# Notes:

- [[Quantal Release]]
    - **Quantum:**
        - 1 packet of neurotransmitter (1 vesicle)
            - This causes a unitary response
                - Either you secrete 1 vesicle, 2 vesicles, 3 vesicles, etc.
                    - Cannot release a fraction of a vesicle
                - The unit involved is a quantum
            - Each vesicle has about the same amount of neurotransmitter packed in them
    - **Spontaneous Postsynaptic Potential**
        - 1 unit is released only
            - This is like a miniature potential
        - Spontaneous, as in no action potential caused this to occur
            - Caused by maybe some extra Ca2+ present in extracellular space
            - Not evoked by any message
    - **Evoked Postsynaptic Potential**
        - An action potential caused this potential to occur
            - Neurotransmitter was intentionally released
                - Can be multiple vesicles released, can be one vesicle released
        - The amplitude of the formed PSP** **is the integral of multiple of mini postsynaptic potentials
    - An experiment can be done to test quantum of PSPs:
        - Stimulate a motor axon, and record **endplate potentials (EPPs)** in the muscle fiber
            - Endplate potentials are the postsynaptic potentials between motor neurons and muscle fibers
                - Different terminology, but same concept as postsynaptic potentials
        - **Miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs)**
            - These are spontaneous endplate potentials
                - Like the name implies, they are quite small and occur randomly
- [[Quantal Analysis]]
    - **Endplate Potential Amplitude Histogram**
        - Number of events that occur at each amplitude
        - Contain a polymodal distribution of peaks
            - This means multiple peaks
        - Histogram peaks are** integral multiples of unitary endplate potentials (MEPPs)**
            - Data tends to cluster around certain amplitudes that are integral multiples of each other
                - Ex: One quantum of NT causes a 0.5mV amplitude EPP, two quanta of NT causes a 1.0mV amplitude EPP, etc.
        - Overlap of peaks implies the same number of vesicles being released
            - A bit like integration in 1-HNMR
        - Recording these potentials from further away gives no results because of the fact that passive potentials dissipate over distance
            - If recording potentials from further away gave results, this would mean that an action potential is occurring due to the electric charge being actively propagated through the muscle cell
        - Anything on these readings of amplitude that have an "S" on them means spontaneous
        - These histograms **display the amplitude of EPPs (X-axis) and how many of them were observed (Y-Axis)**
    - You're gonna want to know how to read/interpret/use one of these histograms for the test
    - The release of neurotransmitters is quantal
        - Meaning, in discrete and defined units
- **EPSP Generation**
    - Neurotransmitters involved:
        - **Acetylcholine (ACh)**
        - **Glutamate (Glu)**
    - Ion selectivity involved
        - Na+, K+, Ca2+
        - Inward current occurring
- **IPSP Generation**
    - Neurotransmitters involved:
        - **y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)**
        - **Glycine (Gly)**
    - Ion selectivity involved:
        - Cl-
        - Outward current occurring
