# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/8/23

# Notes:

- NMDA Receptors
    - Na+, K+, AND Ca2+ permeable
    - Ligand-gated AND voltage-sensitive
        - Mg2+ binding site within the pore
            - Basically blocks the pore
                - Bit like the ball and chain model for the voltage-gated Na+ channel
        - Depolarization induces an unblock in the channel
    - Other modularity sites (sites for binding within these channels):
        - All antagonists here are binding to the allosteric site of the receptor
        - Glycine/serine = Co-agonists
        - Zn2+ = Antagonist
        - PCP = Antagonist
        - Ketamine = Antagonist
        - Antagonists here are gonna cause you to dissociate and trip fucking BALLS because they're blocking excitatory potentials and shit
- The currents for these NMDA receptors is weirdly budding downwards then spikes upwards
    - This budding, then spike, is because of the fact that at more hyperpolarized membrane voltages, there would be more NMDA receptors with Mg2+ blocking the pore
        - This results in significantly less current occurring
        - Depolarization eventually causes the Mg2+ ion to fuck off and for current to kick into positive gear
    - Different from AMPA and Kainate currents
        - These currents go up in almost an exponential growth model
        - Remember that these two are like almost the same thing
    - Reversal potential is the x-intercept of the graph for this receptor current graph
    - Check the slide to see what this is referring to
- Mixed AMPA/NMDA Receptors
    - This is basically an AMPA and NMDA receptor acting as a pair together
        - Glutamate binds to AMPA receptors, causes inward current
            - Forms an EPSP, which then can be a sufficient enough depolarization event to cause the Mg2+ ion to fuck off from the NMDA receptor, which then causes further depolarization because Na+ and Ca2+ can enter the cell through the NMDA receptor
                - This causes big big EPSP occurring
- **NMDA Receptor-Dependent Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**
    - Depolarization via AMPA receptor activation causes expulsion of Mg2+ block from NMDA receptor pore
    - Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors leads to **long-term potentiation (LTP)**
        - LTP is the increased response of a synapse which causes a stronger synapse
            - Related to a memory circuit
                - Related to synaptic plasticity, synaptic growth, etc.
            - Can increase opening rate, extend opening time, etc.
                - Causes enhanced responses overall
        - Can cause the proliferation of NMDA and AMPA receptors within the postsynaptic dendrite
- IPSC/IPSP Generation
    - Neurotransmitters:
        - [[GABA and GABA Receptors|GABA]]
        - [[GABA and GABA Receptors#Glycine|Glycine]]
    - Ion selectivity:
        - Cl-
- IPSP Reversal
    - Inhibitory Interneurons are involved within this process
        - Neurotransmitters involved
            - GABA
                - Generated in the brain
            - Glycine
                - Generated in the brain stem and the spinal cord
    - Receptors involved
        - GABA --> GABAa receptors
        - Glycine --> Glycine receptors
    - Outward current at rest
        - Vreversal = -70mV
        - Cl- current involved with this
            - Remember that Cl- enters the cell, meaning that negative charge is entering the cell
- GABAa Receptors
    - Ionotropic GABA Receptor
        - Heteropentamer
            - 5 subunit types
                - Alpha subunits
                - Beta subunits
                - Gamma subunits
                - Delta subunits
                - Rho subunits
    - Modularity sites
        - GABA (ligand)
        - Barbiturate (agonist)
        - Benzodiazepines (agonist)
        - Steroids (agonist)
        - Picrotoxin (antagonist)
        - Ethanol (agonist)
    - Outward current --> Composed of outward single channel currents
- Shunting Inhibition
    - Shunting of current out of cell via open Cl- channels
    - Inhibitory synapse ahead of a traveling signal causes inhibition through Cl- release
    - Prevents the flow of inward currents to the axon hillock
        - Kinda like a shoulder check to a hockey player
        - Reduces strength/size of EPSPs
- Revisting Reversal Potentials (Cl- ionotropics)
    - When Vm is > -70mV:
        - More positive
        - Cl- flows into the cell due to being attracted to positive electrostatic forces
        - Inward current
    - When Vm is < -70mV
        - Less positive
        - Cl- flows out of the cell due to being repulsed by negative electrostatic forces
        - Outward current
- Revisiting Reversal Potentials (Excitatory ionotropics):
    - When Vm > 0:
        - More positive
        - K+ dominates over Na+ due to higher positive charges forcing K+ out more and repulsing Na+ entry more
        - Outward current
    - When Vm < 0:
        - Less positive
        - Na+ dominates over K+ due to higher negative charges pulling Na+ into the cell more and withdrawing K+ into the cell
        - Inward current
