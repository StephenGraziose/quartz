# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/6/23

# Notes:

- Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs)
    - Has 5 protein subunits (pentamer)
        - 2 alpha subunits, 1 beta subunit, 1 delta subunit, and 1 gamma subunit
            - ACh binding site is at the alpha subunits
                - 2 ACh molecules must bind to the subunits (1 each) to open the channel
    - This is a ligand-gated ion channel
        - Ligand = ACh
        - This channel is selective for both Na+ and K+
    - Overall has a net INWARD current that contains both Na+ influx and K+ efflux
        - Na+ influx dominates K+ efflux
            - This is because there is a greater concentration differential of Na+ between the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell than K+
    - Causes endplate potentials (EPPs)
        - These are the EPSPs of the neuromuscular junction
- Current readings
    - [[Recording Currents#Recording Single Channel Currents|Single Channel Currents]]
        - Recorded with the patch clamp technique
        - Currents are square on the diagrams
        - All-or-none type currents
        - Inward currents
    - [[Recording Currents#Recording Whole Cell Currents|Whole Cell Currents]]
        - Uniform diagram
        - Summation of single-channel currents
    - Reminder that for current diagrams, negative readings means inward current which means influx of positive charge!
- **EPP Reversal Potential**
    - This is the membrane voltage at which **endplate current (EPC)** reverses in its direction
        - INa = IK
            - Or, Iin = Iout
    - The voltage for reverse potential = 0mV
        - Vrev = 0mV
    - Single channel currents here parallel whole-cell currents, except for the fact that they're square in shape
        - Meaning, all-or-none
    - Whole cell currents produce EPPs
    - The direction and amplitude of the current is the sum of its constituent ionic currents
        - Constituent ionic current is a function of the **driving force** on each of the ions involved
- EPSP Generation
    - For the CNS, the major neurotransmitter involved for EPSP generation is **glutamate**
        - Glutamate receptors are selective towards Na+, K+, and sometimes Ca2+ too
- Ionotropic [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors]]
    - There are three different types of Ionotropic Glutamate Receptors:
        - **AMPA Receptors**
            - Na+/K+ permeable
            - Similar to nicotinic ACh receptors
            - Purely ligand sensitive
        - **Kainate Receptors**
            - Na+/K+ permeable
            - Similar to nicotinic ACh receptors
            - Purely ligand sensitive
        - **NMDA Receptors**
            - We'll cover this another time
- EPSP/EPSC Reversals
    - Occurs through the recruitment of afferent axons
        - These are axons projecting away from the intended location
        - This increases stimulus intensity
        - This increases EPSP amplitude
    - The neurotransmitter involved in all of this is glutamate
    - The receptors involved in this are AMPA receptors
    - Reversal potential
        - Mixed Na+/K+ current
        - Vreversal = 0mV
        - Similar to nicotinic ACh receptors
