# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/10/23

# Notes:

### These notes are essentially redundant because they were covered in Lecture 18. I'm still keeping them anyways.

- IPSC/IPSP Generation
    - Neurotransmitters:
        - GABA
        - Glycine
    - Ion selectivity:
        - Cl-
- IPSP Reversal
    - Inhibitory Interneurons are involved within this process
        - Neurotransmitters involved
            - GABA
                - Generated in the brain
            - Glycine
                - Generated in the brain stem and the spinal cord
    - Receptors involved
        - GABA --> GABAa receptors
        - Glycine --> Glycine receptors
    - Outward current at rest
        - Vreversal = -70mV
        - Cl- current involved with this
            - Remember that Cl- enters the cell, meaning that negative charge is entering the cell
- GABAa Receptors
    - Ionotropic GABA Receptor
        - Heteropentamer
            - 5 subunit types
                - Alpha subunits
                - Beta subunits
                - Gamma subunits
                - Delta subunits
                - Rho subunits
    - Modularity sites
        - GABA (ligand)
        - Barbiturate (agonist)
        - Benzodiazepines (agonist)
        - Steroids (agonist)
        - Picrotoxin (antagonist)
        - Ethanol (agonist)
    - Outward current --> Composed of outward single channel currents
- Shunting Inhibition
    - Shunting of current out of cell via open Cl- channels
    - Inhibitory synapse ahead of a traveling signal causes inhibition through Cl- release
    - Prevents the flow of inward currents to the axon hillock
        - Kinda like a shoulder check to a hockey player
        - Reduces strength/size of EPSPs
- Revisting Reversal Potentials (Cl- ionotropics) 
    - When Vm is > -70mV:
        - More positive
        - Cl- flows into the cell due to being attracted to positive electrostatic forces
        - Inward current
    - When Vm is < -70mV
        - Less positive
        - Cl- flows out of the cell due to being repulsed by negative electrostatic forces
        - Outward current
- Revisiting Reversal Potentials (Excitatory ionotropics:
    - When Vm > 0:
        - More positive
        - K+ dominates over Na+ due to higher positive charges forcing K+ out more and repulsing Na+ entry more
        - Outward current
    - When Vm < 0:
        - Less positive
        - Na+ dominates over K+ due to higher negative charges pulling Na+ into the cell more and withdrawing K+ into the cell
        - Inward current
