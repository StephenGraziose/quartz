# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/3/23

# Notes:

- Once released from the presynaptic terminal, the neurotransmitters enter the synaptic cleft and then travel towards the postsynaptic cell
- [[Chemical Synapse Receptors]]
    - **Ionotropic Receptors**
        - These are receptors that are linked to ion channels on the postsynaptic cell
        - Ligand-gated ion channels
        - Receptors form a Receptor-Channel complex
    - **Metabotropic Receptors**
        - Literally G protein-coupled Receptors (GPCRs)
            - 7 transmembrane segment (7TMs) receptors
            - Ligand binds to the receptor
                - Triggers G-protein to trigger the alpha-subunit to become phosphorylated from GTP
                    - Recruits beta-gamma dimer
                        - Both units do their things and eventually phosphorylate adenylyl cyclase
                            - Adenylyl cyclase breaks down ATP into cAMP (second-messenger that further internally relays message)
                            - cAMP binds to second-messenger-gated channels
        - **These are not ion channels**
            - Ions do not pass through them at all
        - These lead to the opening of second-messenger-gated channels
            - Caused by GPCRs triggering an intracellular signaling cascade
- You remember all the types of ion channels
- [[Neurotransmitter Reception]]
    - Receptor subtypes
        - There are multiple receptor subtypes for each neurotransmitter
            - Ex: Acetylcholine (ACh) (See below)
    - **Receptor Agonists**
        - These are molecules that activate neurotransmitter receptors
            - Ex: Nicotine, muscarine, ACh
    - **Receptor Antagonists**
        - These are molecules that block neurotransmitter receptors
            - Ex: Curare, atropine
    - There are two mechanisms of antagonism:
        - **Competitive Antagonists**
            - Physically block the ligand-binding site
                - Can be overcome potentially if there are enough real neurotransmitters present
        - **Allosteric (Noncompetitive) Antagonists**
            - Bind to the allosteric site of the receptor, causing a conformational change that blocks the ligand-binding site
                - Cannot be overcome based on real neurotransmitter concentration
- [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors]] (AChRs)
    - Two AChR subtypes:
        - **Nicotinic** **receptors** **(nAChRs)**
            - Ionotropic
            - Antagonist: **Curare**
                - Competitive behavior
        - **Muscarinic** **receptors** **(mAChRs)**
            - Metabotropic
                - GPCR
            - Antagonist: **Atropine**
                - Competitive behavior
    - These are located in the CNS and PNS too!
- [[The Neuromuscular Junction]] (NMJ)
    - These are specialized synapses at the motor endplate
    - Nerve-muscle synapses for motor neurons
    - Design of the NMJ
        - Axon terminals of presynaptic motor neuron are in the form of multiple **boutons**
            - Boutons contain **active zones**
                - Contain docking and fusion proteins for vesicles
                - Contain mitochondria (energy stores)
                - Contain synaptic vesicles (contain acetylcholine)
        - **Post-synaptic muscle fiber**
            - Contain **junctional folds**
                - Increase the reliability of transmission by localization of acetylcholine receptors to the crests of the folds
                - Enhances the effect of depolarization by localization of sodium channels in the troughs
                - Essentially just like the cristae in the mitochondria, increases the amount of surface area for ion channels
            - Contain Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
                - Remember that these are ionotropic
                    - Activation causes an action potential in muscle fibers
                        - Remember that muscle cells are electrically excitable
        - **Basement Membrane**
            - Contains an enzyme known as **acetylcholinesterase**
                - This enzyme breaks down ACh into choline and acetate
