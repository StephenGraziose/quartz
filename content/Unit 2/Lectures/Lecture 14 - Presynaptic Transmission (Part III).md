# Notes:

- Ca2+ Influx Triggers [[Neurotransmitter Release]]
    - Action potential is conducted to the axon terminal
        - The axon terminal membrane depolarizes
            - Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels open
                - Ca2+ influx occurs
                    - Neurotransmitters are released
- Presynaptic Mechanisms of Neurotransmitter Release
    - Experiment #1: Removal of Ca2+ from extracellular space
        - Action potential still occurred in the presynaptic terminal
        - No PSP occurred though
            - Meaning, no neurotransmitter was released
            - Meaning, neurotransmitter release is Ca2+ dependent
        - Experimental result interpretation:
            - Neurotransmitter release is dependent on Ca2+ ions
    - Experiment #2: Block voltage-gated Na+ channels with TTX
        - No action potential in the presynaptic terminal
        - No PSP occurred
        - Sub-Experiment: Depolarize the presynaptic terminal with voltage step
            - Inward current recorded in the presynaptic terminal
            - PSP occurred
                - Meaning, neurotransmitter was released
        - Sub-Experiment: Use Cd2+ instead of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium
            - No PSP occurred
                - This is because Cd2+ is a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker **(VGCC blocker)**
        - Experimental result interpretation:
            - Neurotransmitter release is NOT voltage-gated Na+ channel dependent
            - Neurotransmitter release involves voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
- **Exocytosis**
    - One instance in which exocytosis occurs in neurons is for neurotransmitter release
    - Exocytosis steps:
        - **1. Vesicle Docking:**
            - Vesicle and plasma membrane **SNARE** **proteins** associate with one another
                - SNARE proteins are associated with a SNAP receptor
                    - Basically form a complex to hold the vesicle down to the cell membrane
                - Vesicle SNARE protein: **Synaptobrevin**
                - Plasma membrane SNARE proteins: **Syntaxin** and **SNAP-25**
        - **2. SNARE Complexes Form:**
            - Vesicle is pulled close to the membrane
                - This is known as **vesicle** **docking** or **priming**
        - **3. Ca2+ Entry:**
            - Interaction with **synaptotagmin** (a Ca2+-sensitive vesicle membrane protein) causes Ca2+ to enter the synaptic terminal neuron
                - Synaptotagmin is not a SNARE protein
        - **4. Fusion:**
            - Vesicle membrane fuses with the plasma membrane
            - This causes neurotransmitter release!
- The molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter release is not directly voltage-dependent
    - However, VGCCs are responsible for allowing Ca2+ to enter the axon terminals
    - Neurotransmitter release is caused by an increase in Ca2+ concentration within the terminal
    - Essentially, neurotransmitter release is Ca2+ dependent
- Synaptic Vesicle Cycle
    - Exocytosis:
        - Vesicle-plasma membrane fusion, neurotransmitter release
            - Vesicle membrane is ADDED to the plasma membrane
                - This causes an increase in membrane surface area and anincrease in cell membrane capacitance
    - Endocytosis:
        - Internal budding of vesicles (**clathrin**-coated vesicles)
            - Clathrin is a protein associated with vesicle endocytosis and cellular signaling during this process
                - Creates a budding shape in the nerve terminal due to its shape
                - **Dynamin** is a membrane protein that helps complete this budding process
            - Vesicle membrane is SUBTRACTED from the plasma membrane
                - This causes a decrease in membrane surface area and adecrease in cell membrane capacitance
