# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 2/17/23

# Notes:

- There are two types of [[Synapses|synaptic transmission]]:
    - **Electrical Synapse**
        - Contain **gap junctions**
            - Involves electronic coupling through ion flow
            - Spread of electric current as a result
            - Rapid form of communication
    - **Chemical Synapse** 
        - Involve chemical transmitters known as **neurotransmitters**
            - These bind to postsynaptic receptors on the postsynaptic neuron
- Gap Junctions
    - Gap junction channels are also known as **cytoplasmic bridges**
        - Channels = 2 **"hemichannels"**
            - The presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons each provide half of a channel (and thus, one hemichannel each)
            - A hemichannel is a **connexon**
                - A connexon is comprised of 6 protein subunits called**connexins**
    - Gap junctions are gated by multiple factors
        - pH
            - Closed by acidification
        - [Ca2+] concentration
            - Closed by high concentrations of Ca2+
        - Are normally open though
    - Gap junctions contain a bidirectional flow of current
        - Rectifying/non-rectifying currents
            - **Rectifying:** Current flows in one direction
            - **Nonrectifying:** Current flows in both directions
        - Rapid transmission
        - Rapid response
            - Acts in synchrony
- Synaptic Current Spread
    - Electrical synapses:
        - Passive current spread to the postsynaptic cell
        - Cytoplasmic bridge
    - Chemical synapses:
        - No direct current spread to postsynaptic cell
        - Chemicals are released from the presynaptic neuron
    - Gap junctions transmit signal passively
        - Similar to the passive conductance of signal within a single neuron, except with non-uniform axial resistance
- **Coupling Coefficient**
    - Electronic coupling through the use of gap junctions
        - **Coupling coefficient** is the measure of the strength of electronic coupling occurring
            - Is a ratio of postsynaptic response to presynaptic response (B:A)
            - Is also a function of the number of gap junction channels
                - Increase in gap junction channels --> Increase in coupling coefficient
                - Decrease in gap junction channels --> Decrease in coupling coefficient
        - The stronger two neurons are electrically coupled, the more gap junction channels there are connecting the two cells
