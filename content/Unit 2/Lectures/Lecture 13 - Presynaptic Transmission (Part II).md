# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 2/24/23

# Notes:

- The chemical synapse is divided into four zones:
    - **Presynaptic region**
        - Neuron that releases neurotransmitter
    - **Active zone**
        - This is where exocytosis of vesicles containing neurotransmitters occurs
    - **Synaptic cleft**
        - This is space between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron where the neurotransmitters are released into
    - **Postsynaptic region**
        - Neuron who has neurotransmitters bind to their ligand-gated ion channels in their dendrites and experiences EPSPs or IPSPs
- Chemical Synaptic Function
    - **Presynaptic Neuron**
        - Action potential causes Ca2+ ion entry through voltage-gated calcium ion channels
            - Ca2+ influx triggers vesicle fusion to the presynaptic cell membrane
                - This results in exocytosis and the release of neurotransmitters
    - **Postsynaptic Neuron**
        - Neurotransmitter binds to ligand-gated ion channels on the postsynaptic cell membrane
            - Triggers the opening of ion channels
                - This results in the influx or efflux of ions
                    - This results in either an EPSP or an IPSP
                        - EPSPs and IPSPs are summated at the axon hillock and trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron if they go suprathreshold
        - Remember the whole directional flow of information in neurons
- Types of Synapses
    - **Axodendritic synapses**
        - Very common type of synapse
        - Axon terminal of presynaptic cell and dendrite of postsynaptic cell
        - Communication can go to different areas of the dendrite:
            - **Dendritic shaft**
                - Usually inhibitory
                - Since the spines grow due to excitatory messages, the shaft becomes the de-facto area for inhibitory signals
            - **Dendritic spine**
                - Usually excitatory
                - Spines usually grow in response to excitation, so they've become the primary area for excitatory messages
        - Regulates postsynaptic excitability
        - Stimulates and inhibits action potential generation
    - **Axosomatic synapses**
        - Axon terminal of presynaptic cell and soma of postsynaptic cell
        - Usually inhibitory
            - Same reason as dendritic shaft
                - If an excitatory message wanted to be sent, it would have gone to the spines
        - Regulates postsynaptic excitability
        - Stimulates and inhibits action potential generation
    - **Axo-axonic synapses**
        - Axon terminal of presynaptic cell communicates with the axon terminal of a postsynaptic cell
            - "Ass to Ass"
        - Causes an increase or decrease in neurotransmitter release
            - Does this by regulating the probability of neurotransmitters being released
        - Reason why it doesn't regulate communication in the same way other synapses do is because if an excitatory or inhibitory message wanted to be sent, it would have been sent to dendrites or even soma
            - Action potential is gonna happen here no matter what, but these synapses help regulate the actual effect of the action potential
                - Changes the amount of positive or negative charge entering the nerve terminal, which affects the amount of neurotransmitter being released
- Chemical Synapse Types
    - **Asymmetric synapses**
        - Excitatory
        - Neurotransmitter used here is **glutamate**
        - The shape is asymmetrical due to having so many glutamate receptors packed in this area
    - **Symmetric synapses**
        - Inhibitory
        - Neurotransmitter used here is **GABA**
        - The shape is symmetrical due to having not that many GABA receptors in that area
- Excitatory and Inhibitory [[Postsynaptic Potentials]]
    - Ah right, should have defined these terms already at some point
    - **Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potential (EPSP)**
        - Increase in positive charge
        - Inward membrane current
        - Causes depolarization
            - Increase in membrane voltage (more positive, becomes higher than RMP)
        - You can also call it an EPSC (current)
            - Same fucking thing
    - **Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential (IPSP)**
        - Decrease in positive charge
        - Outward membrane current
        - Causes hyperpolarization
            - Decrease in membrane voltage (more negative, becomes lower than RMP)
        - You can also call it an IPSC (current)
            - Same fucking thing
    - These occur only at axodendritic and axosomatic synapses
    - The axon hillock summates all EPSPs and IPSPs and generates a summed response
        - Either action potential or no action potential lol
