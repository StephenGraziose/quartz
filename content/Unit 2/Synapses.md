**Synapses** are networks between two different [[neurons]], in which one neuron communicates to another. 

There are two neurons involved in the synapse: The **Presynaptic Neuron** and the **Postsynaptic Neuron**. The presynaptic neuron is the neuron that transmits information, and the postsynaptic neuron is the neuron that receives the information

In addition to this, there are two types of synapses: [[Electrical Synapses]] and [[Chemical Synapses]]
