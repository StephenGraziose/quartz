- **Revisting Reversal Potentials** [[GABA and GABA Receptors|(Cl- ionotropics)]]:
	- When Vm is > -70mV:
		- More positive
		- Cl- flows into the cell due to being attracted to positive electrostatic forces
		- Inward current
	    - When Vm is < -70mV
		- Less positive
		- Cl- flows out of the cell due to being repulsed by negative electrostatic forces
		- Outward current
- **Revisiting Reversal Potentials** [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors|(Excitatory ionotropics)]]:
	- When Vm > 0:
		- More positive
		- K+ dominates over Na+ due to higher positive charges forcing K+ out more and repulsing Na+ entry more
		- Outward current
	- When Vm < 0:
		- Less positive
		- Na+ dominates over K+ due to higher negative charges pulling Na+ into the cell more and withdrawing K+ into the cell
		- Inward current

>[!Note] A Tip:
>
>These numbers sound really complicated to memorize, so just think like an ion!
>
>**For Na+**: There's a lot of Na+ outside of the cell, so a more positive cell membrane would repulse them from entering and a more negative membrane potential would attract them inwards!
>
>**For K+**: There's a ton of K+ inside of the cell, so a more positive cell membrane would repulse them outwards more from the cell and a more negative potential would make them want to stay inside more!
