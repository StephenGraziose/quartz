**Ionotropic receptors** are one of two chemical synaptic receptor types on the postsynaptic cell. They are essentially just ligand-gated ion channels that respond to [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitters.]]

### Ionotropic Receptors
- These are receptors that are linked to ion channels on the postsynaptic cell
	- *Ligand-gated ion channels*
		- Receptors form a Receptor-Channel complex
- Activation leads to **channel opening ONLY**
        - Local actions (as in, only at the synapse)
        - Rapid on-off response
