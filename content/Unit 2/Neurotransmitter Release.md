There are a series of processes that occur at the synaptic end bulbs of the presynaptic cell in order to release [[neurotransmitters]] from the axon terminal into the synaptic cleft. 

The [[Voltage-Gated Channels#Voltage-Gated $Ca {2+}$ Channel|voltage-gated Ca2+ channel]] is responsible for initializing the process of neurotransmitter release.

### Presynaptic Mechanisms of Neurotransmitter Release Experiments
- Experiment #1: Removal of Ca2+ from extracellular space
	- Action potential still occurred in the presynaptic terminal
	- No PSP occurred though
		- Meaning, no neurotransmitter was released
		- Meaning, neurotransmitter release is Ca2+ dependent
	- Experimental result interpretation:
		- Neurotransmitter release is dependent on Ca2+ ions
- Experiment #2: Block voltage-gated Na+ channels with TTX
	- No action potential in the presynaptic terminal
	- No PSP occurred
		- Sub-Experiment: Depolarize the presynaptic terminal with voltage step
		- Inward current recorded in the presynaptic terminal
			- PSP occurred
				- Meaning, neurotransmitter was released
		- Sub-Experiment: Use Cd2+ instead of Ca2+ in the extracellular medium
			- No PSP occurred
			- This is because Cd2+ is a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blocker **(VGCC blocker)**
	- Experimental result interpretation:
		- Neurotransmitter release is NOT voltage-gated Na+ channel dependent
		- Neurotransmitter release involves voltage-gated Ca2+ channels

### Exocytosis
- One instance in which exocytosis occurs in neurons is for neurotransmitter release
- Exocytosis steps:
	- **1. Vesicle Docking:**
		- Vesicle and plasma membrane **SNARE** **proteins** associate with one another
			- SNARE proteins are associated with a SNAP receptor
				- Basically form a complex to hold the vesicle down to the cell membrane
			- Vesicle SNARE protein: **Synaptobrevin**
			- Plasma membrane SNARE proteins: **Syntaxin** and **SNAP-25**
	- **2. SNARE Complexes Form:**
		- Vesicle is pulled close to the membrane
			- This is known as **vesicle** **docking** or **priming**
	- **3. Ca2+ Entry:**
		- Interaction with **synaptotagmin** (a Ca2+-sensitive vesicle membrane protein) causes Ca2+ to enter the synaptic terminal neuron
			- Synaptotagmin is not a SNARE protein
	- **4. Fusion:**
		- Vesicle membrane fuses with the plasma membrane
		- This causes neurotransmitter release!

#### Synaptic Vesicle Cycle
- **Exocytosis:**
	- Vesicle-plasma membrane fusion, neurotransmitter release
		- Vesicle membrane is ADDED to the plasma membrane
			- This causes an increase in membrane surface area and anincrease in cell membrane capacitance
- **Endocytosis:**
	- Internal budding of vesicles (**clathrin**-coated vesicles)
		- Clathrin is a protein associated with vesicle endocytosis and cellular signaling during this process
			- Creates a budding shape in the nerve terminal due to its shape
			- **Dynamin** is a membrane protein that helps complete this budding process
		- Vesicle membrane is SUBTRACTED from the plasma membrane
			- This causes a decrease in membrane surface area and adecrease in cell membrane capacitance
