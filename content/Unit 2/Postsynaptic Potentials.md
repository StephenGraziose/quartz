**Postsynaptic Potentials** are changes in the membrane potential in the postsynaptic neuron as a result of a change in electrical charges, usually due to ions entering or exiting the cell

>Postsynaptic Potentials only occur at **axodendritic** and **axosomatic** synapses.

### Excitatory Post-Synaptic Potential (EPSP)
- Increase in positive charge
	- Inward membrane current
        - Causes depolarization
            - Increase in membrane voltage (more positive, becomes higher than RMP)
        - You can also call it an EPSC (current)
            - Same fucking thing
- **EPSP Generation**
	- Neurotransmitters involved:
		- **Acetylcholine (ACh)**
		- **Glutamate (Glu)**
	- Ion selectivity involved
		- Na+, K+, Ca2+
		- Inward current occurring

### Inhibitory Post-Synaptic Potential (IPSP)
- Decrease in positive charge
	- Outward membrane current
	- Causes hyperpolarization
		- Decrease in membrane voltage (more negative, becomes lower than RMP)
	- You can also call it an IPSC (current)
		- Same fucking thing
- These occur only at axodendritic and axosomatic synapses
- The axon hillock summates all EPSPs and IPSPs and generates a summed response
	- Either action potential or no action potential lol
- **IPSP Generation**
	- Neurotransmitters involved:
		- **y-aminobutyric acid (GABA)**
		- **Glycine (Gly)**
	- Ion selectivity involved:
		- Cl-
		- Outward current occurring

The axon hillock summates all EPSPs and IPSPs and generates a summed response, either an action potential or no action potential.
