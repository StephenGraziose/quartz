### Electrical Synapses
- Contain **gap junctions**
	- Involves electronic coupling through ion flow
	- Spread of electric current as a result
	- Rapid form of communication

#### Gap Junctions
- Gap junction channels are also known as **cytoplasmic bridges**
	- Channels = 2 **"hemichannels"**
		- The presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons each provide half of a channel (and thus, one hemichannel each)
		- A hemichannel is a **connexon**
			- A connexon is comprised of 6 protein subunits called **connexins**
    - Gap junctions are gated by multiple factors
	- pH
		- Closed by acidification
	- [Ca2+] concentration
		- Closed by high concentrations of Ca2+
	- Are normally open though
- Gap junctions contain a bidirectional flow of current
	- Rectifying/non-rectifying currents
		- **Rectifying:** Current flows in one direction
		- **Nonrectifying:** Current flows in both directions
	- Rapid transmission
	- Rapid response
		- Acts in synchrony
	- Passive currents spread to the postsynaptic cell
		- Spreads through a cytoplasmic bridge

#### Coupling Coefficient
- Electronic coupling through the use of gap junctions
	- **Coupling coefficient** is the measure of the strength of electronic coupling occurring
		- Is a ratio of postsynaptic response to presynaptic response (B:A)
		- Is also a function of the number of gap junction channels
			- Increase in gap junction channels --> Increase in coupling coefficient
			- Decrease in gap junction channels --> Decrease in coupling coefficient
	- The stronger two neurons are electrically coupled, **the** **more gap junction channels there are connecting the two cells**
