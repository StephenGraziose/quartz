**Catecholamines** are a type of biogenic amine used as neurotransmitters in the Nervous System. There are three major biogenic amines: **Dopamine, Noradrenaline, and Adrenaline**. They are all heavily-related to one another and all originate from the same synthetic pathway:

Catecholamines are involved in *mood, stress, fluid/energy homeostasis, and reward.* They are also predominant in the functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System.

### Synthesis in the Terminal
- Precursor: **Tyrosine**
	- **Tyrosine hydroxylase** --> DOPA
	- **DOPA decarboxylase** --> Dopamine
	- **Dopamine beta hydroxylase** --> Noradrenaline
	- **PNMT** --> Adrenaline

### Receptors
- Dopamine:
	- Metabotropic D1-D5
- Noradrenaline:
	- Metabotropic alpha and beta
- Adrenaline:
	- Metabotropic alpha and beta

### Dopamine Systems
- Dopamine system is a diffuse modularity system
- Two main sources of dopamine neurons:
	- **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)**
		- **Striatum (the n. accumbens)** is responsible for reward
		- Frontal cortex is responsible for reward as well
			- Also schizophrenia too
		- **Mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways** originate from here
	- **Substantia Nigra**
		- Striatum is responsible for motor control
			- Damage to this causes Parkinson's Disorder
		- **Nigro-striatal dopamine pathway** originates from here

### Noradrenaline Systems

#### CNS
- **Locus Coeruleus (in the Pons)**
	- Cortical and cerebellar projections make up the **dorsal noradenergic bundle**
		- Noradrenaline projected here
	- Also spinal projections too
	- This area is a huge source of noradrenaline throughout the brain
- **Medulla-Brainsteam Noradrenaline System**
	- **Solitary Tract nucleus**
	- **Ventrolateral medulla**
		- Made up by the ventral noradrenergic bundle, subcortical projections
			- Again, another area where noradrenaline is projected
- These zones diffuse noradrenaline into their projections and are responsible for arousal and mood

#### PNS
- **Sympathetic postganglionic neurons**
	- Diffuse noradrenaline to smooth/cardiac muscle tissue and glands (beta receptors)
