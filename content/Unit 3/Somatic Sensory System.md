The **Somatic Sensory System** is a major sensory system in the Nervous System that allows us to detect, interpret, and process sensory stimuli.

### Organization of Sensory Systems
- [[Sensory Transduction]]
- Sensory Receptors
	- [[Neurons]]
		- Include sensory neurons such as somatic neurons and olfactory neurons
	- Epithelial cells
		- Include cells such as visual, auditory, and gustatory cells
- [[Sensory Afferents]] ([[Neurons#Axon|Axons]])
	- Arrive at the CNS
	- Remember that afferent means arriving to the CNS and efferent means exiting the CNS
- Afferent Circuit
	- Usually take a pit stop in the **thalamus**
		- Huge relay center in the brain
	- Terminate in the appropriate sensory cortex
		- Just dump some information off to some relevant cortical region
	- This is used for the different [[Somatic Sensory Pathways|somatic sensory pathways.]]

### Somatic Sensory Receptors in the Skin
- Skin Receptors = Transduction
	- Three submodalities:
		- Touch/Pressure
		- Temperature
		- Pain
#### Mechanoreceptors (touch)
- **Pacinian corpuscle**
	- Receptive field size: Large
	- Adaptation: Fast
- **Ruffini's endings**
	- Receptive field size: Large
	- Adaptation: Slow
- **Merkel's disks**
	- Receptive field size: Small
	- Adaptation: Slow
- **Meissner's corpuscles**
	- Receptive field size: Small
	- Adaptation: Fast
- Hair follicle receptors
- Have A-beta axons only

#### Thermoreceptors (temperature)
- Free nerve endings
	- Just free nerves chilling around lol
- Have C axons and A-delta axons

#### Nociceptors (pain)
- Free nerve endings
	- Just free nerves chilling around lol
- Have C axons and A-delta axons

### Somatic Sensory Cortex
- This is found in the **parietal lobe** and the **postcentral gyrus**
- There are four lobes of the cerebral cortex
	- Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe
- Somatotropic organization of the somatic sensory cortex
	- They made a complete somatotopic map of the body based on where interactions occur at the somatic sensory cortex
		- There is a disproportionate representation of parts of the body here
			- Due to higher sensitivity (greater innervation) of body parts and more projections to the cortex from these parts

### Lateral Inhibition
- Application of a stimulus to the center of a receptive field excites a neuron, but a stimulus applied near the edge inhibits it
- Center-surround receptive fields
	- Center = Excitatory
	- Surround area = Inhibitory
- Enhances spatial resolution
	- This is achieved through the process of enhancing contrast
- 2nd order neurons experience a convergence here
	- Projection of multiple 1st and 2nd order cells
		- Sum of their receptive fields
- This all occurs through inhibitory interneurons
	- These interneurons inhibit their neighbors
