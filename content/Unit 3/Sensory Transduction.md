**Sensory Transduction** is the conversion of a *physical signal to a neural signal.*

- Encodes four properties of sensations into action potentials
		- **Modality**
			- What kind of sense?
		- **Intensity**
			- How strong of that type of sense?
		- **Duration**
			- How long does that sense last for?
		- **Location**
			- Where is the stimulus found at?

### Modality
- **5 Main Modalities (qualities)**
	- [[Visual System|Vision]]
	- [[Auditory System|Hearing]]
	- Touch
	- Taste
	- Smell
	- **Submodalities**
		- Different qualities within a modality
			- Ex: Touch --> Pressure, temperature, pain
- Specific receptors associates with each modality/submodality
	- Vision = Photoreceptors
	- Audition = Mechanoreceptors
	- Somatic sensation = Mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors
		- Proprioception = Chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors
	- Taste = Chemoreceptors
	- Smell = Chemoreceptors
- Each modality is associated with specific central pathways
	- Relay through subnuclei of the thalamus
	- Terminate in specific cortical areas (visual, auditory, somatosensory cortices, olfactory cortex, gustatory area)
- **Mechanoreceptors**
	- Touch, pressure
- **Thermoreceptors**
	- Temperature
- **Nociceptors**
	- Pain

### Intensity
- **Threshold**
	- Minimum stimulus strength needed to elicit a response
- **Intensity**
	- **Frequency coding**
		- Strength of the stimulus is encoded in frequency of action potential discharge in single neurons
			- Greater discharge frequency --> Greater perceived intensity
	- **Population coding**
		- Strength of the stimulus is encoded in several neurons recruited into activity
			- Greater intensity --> Greater number of neurons recruited
			- Greater number of neurons recruited --> Greater perceived intensity

### Duration
- Adaptation
	- All receptors adapt!
	- Continued stimulation --> Decreased potential amplitude
	- Causes a decreased frequency in action potentials occurring
	- 1st order neurons = Receptor area
- Slowly adapting receptors
	- Tonic activation
	- Detection of persistent sensory signals
- Rapidly adapting receptors
	- Rapidly shut off
	- Active only with onset/offset with stimulus
	- Detection of transient sensory signals

### Location
- Receptive field of receptors helps determine the location of the specific stimulus
- Receptor density also helps determine the location of the specific stimulus
	- 2-point discrimination
