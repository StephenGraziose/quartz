Along with being able to process and detect sound, the [[Auditory System]] is capable of distinguishing the intensity, frequency, and location of sound as well.

### Sound Intensity

#### Intensity Coding - Frequency Coding

>[!warning] Don't get confused!
>
>Frequency coding for intensity is NOT related to the frequency of the sound itself. The term "frequency" is referring to the frequency of action potentials being fired from the spiral ganglion cells!

- This is the spiral ganglion cell's firing rate
	- This causes either a greater depolarization or hyperpolarization of hair cells
		- Causes almost a weird cycle of depolarization and hyperpolarization of these cells, resulting in higher and lower releases of glutamate
			- This also causes an increase in the firing frequency of single spiral ganglion cells
				- Either very frequent action potentials or infrequent frequent action potentials
		- More spikes here means more intense sound
		- Less spikes means less intense
	- Remember that sounds can have <u>different intensities at the same frequency</u>

#### Intensity Coding - Population Coding
- This is the number of spiral ganglion neurons recruited
	- Multiple spiral ganglion cells are becoming active and firing action potentials
	- This causes an activation of more hair cells
		- More neurotransmitter ([[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors|glutamate]] mostly) secretion to spiral ganglion cells by the hair cells

### Sound Frequency

#### Frequency Sensitivity - Tonotopy
- **Tonotopy** is the frequency of sound
	- Basilar membrane
		- The base of the membrane is narrow and rigid
	        - The apex of the membrane is wide and flexible
	- The base and apex of the basilar membrane have different frequency sensitivities
		- **Base**
			- Sensitive to *higher frequencies (due to higher rigidity)*
		- **Apex**
			- Sensitive to *lower frequencies (due to lower rigidity)*
	- Essentially, the basiliar membrane is responsible for being sensitive to the frequency of sounds
	- Tonotopic organization of the cochlea
		- As a result of these sensitivity differences, the cochlea is organized based on coding sounds and their frequencies
			- This leads to different tonotopic transmission to the brain

#### Frequency Sensitivity - Phase Locking
- **Phase Locking**
	- A pattern that neurons can fire in to basically code for the frequency of sound
		- Low frequencies:
			- Phase locking occurs on every cycle or some fraction of cycles
				- This is combined with the tonotopic detection of frequency
		- High frequencies:
			- This is not fixed, and this relies on tonotopic detection of frequency alone
			- Sound waves are too frequent for the neuron to keep up with
	- Basically, the neurons fire action potentials in phase with the frequency of the sound waves
		- Neurons match the frequency of the wave
			- Kinda like matching the beat
	- Brain can use phase locking and previously-determined tonotopy to determine the frequency of a sound

### Sound Localization

#### Horizontal Sound Localization
- Sound is horizontally localized due to there being an **interaural delay between both ears at a range of 20-2000Hz**
	- This is the difference in time it takes for sudden sound to arrive at each ear
		- Not continued or enduring sound (they kinda just hit at the same time at some point)
    - There is also an interaural intensity difference between each ear that ranges between 2-20KHz
    - Sound shadows are also a part of this, in which sometimes a solid object such as your head blocks out
- Mechanisms of Sound Localization
    - Sensitivity of binaural neurons to sound location
    - Basis for sound localization mechanism is because of the interaural delay of sudden sounds
    - The superior olives transmit information from one side to the opposite counterpart side of the cortex
	- Ex: Left sounds get transported to the right side of the cortex here
	- Action potentials hit the superior olives at slightly delayed times
		- Action potentials go from left to right and collide with each other when they come from opposite sides

#### Vertical Sound Localization
- Sound is vertically localized based on the **curves and folds of the pinna**
	- Sounds just sorta bounce off and around the shape of the pinna and cause a strange sort of vertical localization
- Small differences in delay occur between direct/reflected sound
	- A tube in your ear will eliminate pinna influence from coding sound
		- This results in the elimination of vertical localization of sound
