The Somatic Nervous System is organized into **primary afferents.** These are the different types of [[Neurons#Axon|axons]] that convey information to the brain and the CNS.

These axons are differentiated by their diameters and their myelination:

- **A-alpha**
	- Large diameter
	- Myelinated
- **A-beta**
	- Medium diameter
	- Myelinated
    - **A-delta**
	- Small diameter
	- Myelinated
    - **C**
	- Small diameter
	- Unmyelinated

- Mechanoreceptors
	- Have A-beta axons only
- Thermoreceptors
	- Have C axons and A-delta axons
- Nociceptors
	- Have C axons and A-delta axons
