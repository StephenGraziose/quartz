The **Auditory System** is the sensory system in the Nervous System that is used for the sensation and interpretation of auditory signals (sound).

[[Sound Transduction|Sound itself is tranduced once it is heard.]]

[[Sound Intensity, Frequency and Localization|Sounds are also characterized by intensity, frequency, and location as well.]]

### Sound Overview
- Formation of Sound Waves
	- Air **compression** (an increase in air pressure) and **rarefaction** (a decrease in air pressure)
		- This generates sound waves
	- Sound waves have waveform characteristics
		- **Frequency:**
			- Pitch or tone
		- **Amplitude:**
			- Height of the peaks
			- Loudness and volume

### The Ear
There is an **Outer, Middle, and Inner Ear**.

#### Outer Ear
- **Pinna**
	- Sound immediately enters through here
- **Auditory Canal**
	- Once passing the pinna, sound passes through the auditory canal

#### Middle Ear
- **Middle Ear**
	- **Tympanic Membrane**
		- Ear drum
	- **Ossicles**
		- Small little bones within the ear that connect the tympanic membrane to the inner ear
			- Consist of the **Malleus, Incus,** and **Stapes**
				- These are connected to the Oval Window of the Cochlea

#### Inner Ear
- **Vestibular Apparatus**
- **Cochlea**
	- Coiled tube-like snail shell
		- Has three fluid-filled chambers (they look like pockets in a cross section of the cochlea)
			- Two large chambers:
				- **Scala Vestibuli**
				- **Scala Tympani**
			- One smaller chamber:
				- **Scala Media**
					- This is within the cochlear portion
					- This contains the **Organ of Corti**
					- Between the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani
		- Contains the **Helicotrema**
			- This is the apex of the cochlea
				- This connects the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani together
		- Contains various fluids
			- In the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani:
				- [[Perilymph]]
			- In the Scala Media:
				- [[Endolymph]]
			- These fluids differ in their **concentrations of ions**, which especially becomes relevant with the hair cells in the Scala Media
