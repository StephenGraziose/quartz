**Neurotransmitters** are molecules that are used in chemical synapses for basic communication between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron. [[Neurotransmitter Release|They are released from the presynaptic neurons through exocytosis]] and will bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron.

## List of Major Neurotransmitters Covered During This Course:

- [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors]]
- [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors]]
- [[GABA and GABA Receptors]]
- [[Glycine and Glycine Receptors]]
- [[Catecholamines|Dopamine]]
- [[Catecholamines|Noradrenaline]]
- [[Catecholamines|Adrenaline]]
- [[Serotonin and Serotonin Receptors|Serotonin]]

### Neurotransmitter Criteria
1. Synthesized/stored in the presynaptic terminals
	- Analyzed through **immunohistochemistry**
2.  Released from synaptic terminals with stimulation
	- Analyzed through **microdialysis and chemical assays**
3.  Has specific receptors on postsynaptic cells
	- Analyzed through **neuropharmacology and autoradiography**

### Types of Neurotransmitters

#### Small Molecule Neurotransmitters
- Amino acids:
	- Excitatory and inhibitory
		- Ex: [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors|Glutamate]], [[GABA and GABA Receptors|GABA]], [[Glycine and Glycine Receptors|Glycine]]
	- [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors|Acetylcholine]]
	- **Biogenic amines**
		- [[Catecholamines]]
			- Dopamine, Noradrenaline, adrenaline
		- **Indolamines**
			- [[Serotonin and Serotonin Receptors|Serotonin]], melatonin
		- **Histamine**

#### Neuropeptides
- Hypothalamic peptides
- Opioids
- Gut peptides
- Synthesis:
	- Precursor proteins packaged in dense-core vesicles
		- These vesicles have a dense ass core
	- Fast anterograde transport to the terminal
	- Cleave precursors into neurotransmitters
- Release:
	- ~100 different neuropeptides released by different neurons in the brain
	- Usually co-released with classical neurotransmitters as well
- Co-release of Neurotransmitters
- Co-localization of transmitters
	- Small molecule NTs and neuropeptides are often located in the same terminals
	- Different location of vesicles
		- Synaptic vesicles (small) at the membrane
		- **Synaptic** **granules (large)** off from the membrane
- Different conditions of exocytosis
	- Low frequency firing --> low ${[Ca^{2+}]}$ --> small molecule neurotransmitter release
	- High frequency firing --> high ${[Ca^{2+}]}$ --> small molecule neurotransmitter AND neuropeptide release

#### Unconventional Neurotransmitters
- Gases
	- Nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide
- Lipids
	- Endocannbinoids, prostaglandins
- Growth factors/cytokines

### Neurotransmitter Synthesis, Packaging, and Transport

#### For Small Molecule Neurotransmitters:
- Synthesis of **metabolic enzymes** occurs
	- Cytosolic proteins are synthesized by ribosomes
		- Transported to the axon terminals through slow axoplasmic flow
	- Synthesis of neurotransmitter occurs in the axon terminals
	- Vesicular transporters are responsible for uptaking the neurotransmitters into the vesicles
	- Release occurs though exocytosis

#### For Neuropeptides:
- Synthesis of precursor proteins occurs
	- Packaging in **dense-core vesicles**
		- These are formed by [[Proteins#Membrane-associated proteins|membrane proteins]]
	- Transported to the axon terminals through fast anterograde transport
	- The neurotransmitters are formed by the cleavage of the precursors into the neurotransmitters
	- Release occurs through exocytosis
