The transduction of sound is a process that occurs in the cochlea of the ear, and is a relatively complicated process:

### Transduction of Sound
- This occurs within the Organ of Corti in the Scala Media
	- Contains both inner and outer **hair cells**
		- They brush and move due to sound waves, which form hair cell receptor potentials
	- Contains two membrane layers that sandwich the organ
		- **Tectorial Membrane**
			- Sits atop of the organ
		- **Basilar Membrane**
			- On the underside of the organ
	- Also contains afferent axons to transfer information to the brain
- Transduction
	- Fluid waves in the endolymph and perilymph
	- Cause oscillations to occur in the Basilar membrane
		- This causes the movement of hair cells in the Organ
			- This causes the movement of **stereocilia** within the Tectorial Membrane
				- Stereocilia are small hairs that are bound to hair cells
					- They start small and gradually increase in size as you move along the hair cell
						- Short cilia = Small cilia
						- Long cilia = Large cilia



### Stereocilia Movements
- Basilar membrane oscillations due to fluid waves causes the forward and backward movements of stereocilia
	- Movements of the stereocilia cause the opening of different ion channels

### Hair Cells
- **Hair cells** are the specialized inner-ear cells that are responsible for the transduction of sound into electrical signals
	- Convert sound waves into receptor potentials
- Hair cells have a -45mV resting potential
	- Extracellular space is the **endolymph**
	- There are K+ channels found on stereocilia
		- Opening these channels causes a depolarization event due to the fact that there is a higher concentration of K+ outside of the cells in the endolymph than inside of the cells
			- This is like the opposite of a typical neuron
		- Closing these channels causes a hyperpolarization event
	- There are also K+ channels found on the base of the hair cell that is submerged in the perilymph
		- Opening these channels causes a hyperpolarization event (K+ efflux from cell rich with K+)
		- Closing these channels causes a depolarization event (More positive charges accumulate)
- Innervation of Hair Cells
	- There is a 3:1 ratio of outer to inner hair cells
	- 95% of all spiral ganglion cells communicate through synapses with inner hair cells
		- Each spiral ganglion cell synapses with single inner hair cell
		- Remember that a ganglion is a collection of cell bodies in the PNS
- **Inner hair cells** provide the <u>most information</u> to the brain
	- Very specific to the frequency of sound
- **Outer hair cells** help <u>amplify the basilar membrane oscillations</u> when fluid waves pass through
	- <u>Amplify by about 100x</u>
	- This is like their point of existing

### Mechano-Electric Transduction
- [[Ion Channels#Mechanically-Gated Ion Channels|Mechanically-Gated]] K+ Channels
	- Are present on stereocilia
	- Movement toward the long cilia --> Opening of the channel
	- Movement towards the short cilia --> Closing of the channel
	- Stretch causes the opening of channels
- The opening of ciliar K+ channels
	- This causes an influx of K+
		- This causes the depolarization of the hair cell
			- This causes the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels located at the base of the hair cell
				- This causes the release of [[Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors|glutamate]] neurotransmitter
					- This causes the activation of **Spiral Ganglion Cells**
						- These are auditory afferents
						- They're like the 2nd order cells in this chain
						- Move auditory information to the thalamus and then cortex

### Auditory Signals
- Sound waves
	- Remember that sound waves are formed through the compression and rarefaction of air
	- Sound waves are **sinusoidal waves**
		- Sine waves
	- Sinusoidal waves in the perilymph cause mechanical pressure to build up on the oval window
		- This causes fluid waves to be set up
- Opening and closing of mechanically-gated K+ channels
	- Causes the depolarization and hyperpolarization of hair cells, respectively
	- This act reproduces the sinusoidal wave up to high frequencies

### Auditory Pathway
- You won't have to remember "super mucho" about these pathways (her words, not mine)
	- This is a slight bit complicated though
- Spiral ganglion connects to the **ventral cochlear nucleus** through the **auditory nerve**
	- The ventral cochlear nucleus then transmits the information to the **superior olive**
		- The superior olive (in the medulla) is neat because this is where information can cross over to the other hemisphere
			- There are two superior olives, one for each hemisphere of the brain
				- The delay of crossing over to the other hemisphere causes the ability to determine the directionality of sound
		- Dorsal cochlear projections here go to the **inferior colliculus** (in the midbrain)
			- Inferior colliculus projects to the **superior colliculus** and the **Medial Geniculate nucleus** and the cerebellum
				- This causes integration with vision
					- This helps coordinate motor output
						- That's pretty neat!
				- From the cerebellum, information then travels to the auditory cortex
					- Tada! That's the way it goes
