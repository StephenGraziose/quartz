**Synaptic Modulation** is an observed change in synaptic functioning. This is caused by both [[Ionotropic Receptors]] and [[Metabotropic Receptors]]. 

There exists both **Presynaptic Modualtion** and **Postsynaptic Modulation**.

### Presynaptic Modulation

> [!info]
> 
> Presynaptic modulation essentially just makes the presynaptic neuron either more excited or less excited, resulting in it releasing more or less neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.

- Axoaxonic synapses OR retrograde messenger actions
	- Increases/decreases in neurotransmitter release
		- All regulated by the *probability of neurotransmitter release*
	- Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors
		- Cause decrease in glutamate release and decrease in [[GABA and GABA Receptors|GABA]] release
	- Presynaptic GABAb receptors
		- Cause decrease in GABA release and decrease in glutamate release
- Effects of Ca2+ channels on synaptic proteins
	- Metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibit synaptic proteins
	- GABAb receptors inhibit Ca2+ channels

Presynaptic modulation also has a few unique examples and effects, including **retrograde messengers** and **spillover.**

#### Retrograde Messengers
- **Retrograde messengers** are neurotransmitters that originally are released from a presynaptic neuron and bind to a postsynaptic neuron's receptor on their cell membrane
	- Just like regular, you know?
	- BUT THEN, the postsynaptic cell shits out an endocannabinoid molecule that binds to the presynaptic cell and causes *additional glutamate release*
		- This only really occurs with glutamate, and causes less excitation in the presynaptic neuron
			- Can cause less future action potentials then

#### Spillover
- **Spillover** is the process that occurs when excess neurotransmitters are released from a neuron into the synaptic cleft and some of the neurotransmitters exit the cleft.
	- These neurotransmitters can bind to GPCRs for other neurons or even the same neuron
		- This leads to a release in GABA that inhibits the initial neuron
- Basically, my cup runneth over.
	- Or diarrhea in your pants
- This only works with **GABA**!
	- This is an inhibitory thing!

### Postsynaptic Modulation

>[!info]
>
>Postsynaptic modulation essentially are just EPSPs and IPSPs. They either depolarize or hyperpolarize the postsynaptic neuron, which makes an action potential either more likely or less likely, respectively.

- Postsynaptic modulation occurs through both [[Chemical Synapses#Chemical Synapse Types (Neuron Structures Involved)|axosomatic and axodendritic synapses]]
	- Depolarization and hyperpolarization of postsynaptic cell
	- Increase/decrease in conductance (such as the opening or closing of channels)
	- Ex: Glutamate and GABA
		- Glutamate
			- Metabotropic glutamate receptors **(mGluRs)** --> Closing of K+ channels --> Depolarization --> Excitation
		- GABA
			- GABAb receptors --> Opening of K+ channels --> Hyperpolarization --> Inhibition
- Also, ionotropic receptors cause fast postsynaptic modulation, and metabotropic receptors cause slow postsynaptic modulation, as seen below
