**Cholergic Systems** are systems in the CNS and PNS that are heavily-linked to the neurotransmitter [[Acetylcholine and Acetylcholine Receptors|Acetylcholine.]] These systems are used to diffuse the neurotransmitter.

### CNS Cholinergic Systems
- CNS acetylcholine system is used to diffuse acetylcholine throughout the brain
	- Three distinct sources:
		- **PMT Complex**
			- Diffuse acetylcholine to basal forebrain projections
		- **Basal Nucleus of Meynert**
			- Diffuse acetylcholine to cortical projections
				- Cortical projections meaning the cerebral cortex (the big part of the brain)
			- Remember that the nucleus are where the cell bodies of all these neurons are, but the ACh gets released from their axons
		- **Medial Septum**
			- Diffuse acetylcholine to cortical and hippocampal projections
				- Acetylcholine fibers lost in **Alzheimer's Disease**
					- Cause issues in memory and attention

### PNS Cholinergic Systems
- PNS Acetylcholine system is used to diffuse acetylcholine into somatic and autonomic motor neurons in the peripheral nervous system
	- **Somatic motor neurons**
		- Diffuse acetylcholine to skeletal muscle tissue
	- **Sympathetic preganglionic neurons**
		- Diffuse acetylcholine to sympathetic postganglionic neurons
		- Remember that sympathetic nervous system is that fight or flight system
	- **Parasympathetic pre and post-ganglionic neurons**
		- Diffuse acetylcholine to smooth/cardiac muscle tissues and also glands
		- Remember that the parasympathetic nervous system is that rest and digest system
