# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 4/10/23

# Notes:

**Do not stress the auditory pathways as of yet, but remember the pain and temperature pathways from past topics discussed during this unit**

- Sound Intensity
    - Caused by larger basilar membrane oscillations
    - Remember that a greater amplitude of sound means louder and more intense sound
    - **Intensity coding**
        - **Frequency code**
            - This is the spiral ganglion's firing rate
                - This causes either a greater depolarization or hyperpolarization of hair cells
                    - Causes almost a weird cycle of depolarization and hyperpolarization of these cells, resulting in higher and lower releases of glutamate
                - This also causes an increase in the firing frequency of single spiral ganglion cells
                    - Either very frequent action potentials or less frequent action potentials
                        - This is used to indicate the intensity of sound too
            - More spikes here means more intense sound
                - Less spikes means less intense
                - Remember that sounds can have different intensities at the same frequency
    - **Population code**
        - This is the number of spiral ganglion neurons recruited
            - Multiple spiral ganglion cells are becoming active and firing action potentials
        - This causes an activation of more hair cells
            - More neurotransmitter (glutamate mostly) secretion to spiral ganglion cells by the hair cells
    - Sound coding is very similar to the mechanisms of touch coding
- **Horizontal Sound Localization**
    - Sound is horizontally localized due to there being an interaural delay between both ears at a range of 20-2000Hz
        - This is the difference in time it takes for sudden sound to arrive at each ear
            - Not continued or enduring sound (they kinda just hit at the same time at some point)
    - There is also an interaural intensity difference between each ear that ranges between 2-20KHz
    - Sound shadows are also a part of this, in which sometimes a solid object such as your head blocks out
- Mechanisms of Sound Localization
    - Sensitivity of binaural neurons to sound location
    - Basis for sound localization mechanism is because of the interaural delay of sudden sounds
    - The superior olives transmit information from one side to the opposite counterpart side of the cortex
        - Ex: Left sounds get transported to the right side of the cortex here
        - Action potentials hit the superior olives at slightly delayed times
            - Action potentials go from left to right and collide with each other when they come from opposite sides
- **Vertical Sound Localization**
    - Sound is vertically localized based on the curves and folds of the pinna
        - Sounds just sorta bounce off and around the shape of the pinna and cause a strange sort of vertical localization
    - Small differences in delay occur between direct/reflected sound
        - A tube in your ear will eliminate pinna influence from coding sound
            - This results in the elimination of vertical localization of sound
- Frequency Coding - Tonotopy
    - Essentially, different areas in the brain are used to process different frequencies of sound within the primary and secondary auditory cortices
    - **Tonotopy**
        - The frequencies of sound
- Frequency Sensitivity - Phase Locking
    - **Phase Locking**
        - A pattern that neurons can fire in to basically code for the frequency of sound
            - Low frequencies:
                - Phase locking occurs on every cycle or some fraction of cycles
                    - This is combined with the tonotopic detection of frequency
            - High frequencies:
                - This is not fixed, and this relies on tonotopic detection of frequency alone
                - Sound waves are too frequent for the neuron to keep up with
        - Basically, the neurons fire action potentials in phase with the frequency of the sound waves
            - Neurons match the frequency of the wave
                - Kinda like matching the beat
        - Brain can use phase locking and previously-determined tonotopy to determine the frequency of a sound
- Auditory Cortex vs Somatosensory Cortex
    - The postcentral gyrus is basically where the entireity of the somatosensory cortex is
        - Body areas and sensation are mapped based on the amount of brain tissue that is devoted to the area and sensation
    - The auditory cortex is in the **temporal lobe**
