# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/29/23

# Notes:

- Four types of primary afferents
    - So before we start, the somatic nervous system is organized into **primary afferents**
        - These are the different types of axons that convey information to the brain and CNS
        - These different axons are based on their diameters
    - **A-alpha**
        - Large diameter
        - Myelinated
    - **A-beta**
        - Medium diameter
        - Myelinated
    - **A-delta**
        - Small diameter
        - Myelinated
    - **C**
        - Small diameter
        - Unmyelinated
    - Mechanoreceptors
        - Have A-beta axons only
    - Thermoreceptors
        - Have C axons and A-delta axons
    - Nociceptors
        - Have C axons and A-delta axons
- Receptors (submodalities)
    - Remember that the senses of nervous system is organized into modalities, with each modality having submodalities
    - For the somatic nervous system, the following submodalities exist with the following receptors:
        - **Mechanoreceptors**
            - Touch, pressure
        - **Thermoreceptors**
            - Temperature
        - **Nociceptors**
            - Pain
- Primary sensory neurons
    - First order neurons
    - Found in the **Dorsal Root Ganglia**
    - Peripheral end contains a receptor
    - Central end contains an axon terminal and a synapse
- Anatomical terms that are about to be used:
    - **Ipsilateral**
        - Same side of the body where the brain is
            - As in left side of the body affected by left hemisphere of the brain
    - **Contralateral**
        - Opposite side of the body from where the brain is
            - As in left side of body affected by right hemisphere of the brain
- There are two main somatic sensory pathways in the somatic sensory system **(KNOW THESE)**
    - **Dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway**
        - Used by mechanoreceptors
        - 2nd order neurons are found in the **medulla**
        - Touch and pressure and proprioception
        - Anatomical parts involved:
            - **Spinal cord**
                - **Ipsilateral dorsal column**
                - Starts here
                - This is placeholder text so that nothing goes to shit here
            - **Medulla**
                - **Dorsal column nuclei**
                    - This is ipsilateral
                    - **Gracile nucleus**
                    - **Cuneate nucleus**
                - Moves here from the ipsilateral dorsal column
            - **Medial lemniscus (where crossing over occurs)**
                - This is contralateral
                - Moves here from the dorsal column nuclei
            - **Thalamus**
                - This is contralateral
                - 3rd order neurons live here
                - Moves here from the **medial lemniscus**
            - **Primary somatic sensory cortex**
                - This is contralateral
                - Moves here from the thalamus
    - **Spinothalamic pathway**
        - Used by thermoreceptors and nociceptors
        - 2nd order neurons are found in the **dorsal horn**
        - Temperature and pain
        - Anatomical parts involved:
            - **Spinal cord**
                - **Ipsilateral dorsal horn**
                - Starts here
                - 2nd order neurons live here (in the dorsal horn)
            - **Contralateral spinothalamic tract (where crossing over occurs)**
                - Also known as the **ventrolateral** **column**
            - **Thalamus**
                - This is contralateral
                - 3rd order neurons live here
                - Contains **ventral posterior nucleus**
                    - Leads to** intralaminar nucleus**
            - **Primary somatic sensory cortex**
                - This is contralateral
- **Somatic Sensory Cortex**
    - This is found in the **parietal lobe** and the **postcentral gyrus**
    - There are four lobes of the cerebral cortex
        - Frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe
- Somatotropic organization of the somatic sensory cortex
    - They made a complete somatotopic map of the body based on where interactions occur at the somatic sensory cortex
        - There is a disproportionate representation of parts of the body here
            - Due to higher sensitivity (greater innervation) of body parts and more projections to the cortex from these parts
- Just memorize the pathways this isn't that particularly crazy
    - The poll question is the hardest question she can give you on this
- **Lateral Inhibition**
    - Application of a stimulus to the center of a receptive field excites a neuron, but a stimulus applied near the edge inhibits it
    - Center-surround receptive fields
        - Center = Excitatory
        - Surround area = Inhibitory
    - Enhances spatial resolution
        - This is achieved through the process of enhancing contrast
    - 2nd order neurons experience a convergence here
        - Projection of multiple 1st and 2nd order cells
            - Sum of their receptive fields
    - This all occurs through inhibitory interneurons
        - These interneurons inhibit their neighbors
