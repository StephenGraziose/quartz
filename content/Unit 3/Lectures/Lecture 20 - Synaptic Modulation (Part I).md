# Notes:

- [[Metabotropic Receptors]]
    - Remember that metabotropic receptors are **G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)**
        - 7 transmembrane regions (7-pass protein)
        - Associated with the **G protein**
            - GDP binding protein
        - This is a 2nd messenger system
            - This is for intracellular messengers
            - Indirect gating of channels
    - Signaling Sequence
        - Some signal or ligand binds to the receptor outside of the cell membrane
            - G protein is activated
                - 2nd messengers are activated or created
                    - Kinase activation occurs
                        - Phosphorylation of channel proteins occurs
- G Protein Activation
    - The G protein
        - Has 3 protein subunits
            - **Alpha, beta, and gamma subunits**
        - The G protein is membrane-associated
            - Lipid-bound
        - GDP is bound to the alpha subunit when the alpha subunit is inactive
    - Ligand binding to the GPCR
        - G protein associates with the receptor in general
        - Once the ligand binds to the GPCR, the G protein is activated
            - GTP binds to the alpha subunit and kicks off GDP
            - The **alpha-GTP subunit** then dissociates from the beta and gamma subunits, and the **beta-gamma dimer** forms as a result
                - Both the alpha-GTP subunit and the beta-gamma dimer can each signal other things
                    - Meaning, they can trigger other reactions within the cell
                    - The alpha-GTP subunit activates 2nd messenger systems
                    - The beta-gamma dimer can act directly on ion channels
- 2nd Messenger Systems
    - Model of activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)
        - 1. "First transmitter" (neurotransmitter or other ligand) binds to the receptor
        - 2. G protein activated (GTP binding to the alpha subunit) ("transducer", begins signal transduction pathway)
        - 3. Primary effector enzyme activated
        - 4. 2nd messengers formed
        - 5. Secondary effector enzyme activated
            - Ex: Kinase
        - 6. Activation of target proteins
            - Can be achieved through phosphorylation or through other means
    - There are 2 major 2nd messenger systems:
        - cAMP system
        - Phosphoinositol system
- **cAMP 2nd Messenger System**
    - **Gs** and **Gi**
        - **Gs**
            - Title is "G alpha s"
            - Stimulatory G protein
            - Stimulates **adenylyl cyclase**
                - This is an enzyme that generates cAMP (cyclic AMP) from ATP
                - cAMP production increases
        - **Gi**
            - Title is "G alpha i"
            - Inhibitory G protein
            - Inhibits adenylyl cyclase
                - cAMP production decreases
    - cAMP activates **cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (PKA)**
        - PKA is a secondary effector that leads to the phosphorylation of target proteins
- **Phosphoinositol System**
    - **Gq**
        - Title is "G alpha q"
        - A G protein that stimulates **phospholipase C (PLC)**
            - PLC leads to the production of **inositol triphosphate (IP3)** and **diacyl glycerol (DAG)** from **PIP2** (a membrane lipid precursor)
    - IP3
        - Inositol triphosphate leads to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores at the SER
            - Increases [Ca2+]
    - DAG
        - Diacyl glycerol activates **protein kinase C (PKC)**
            - This protein kinase's activity is dependent on Ca2+ concentration
            - PKC goes on and does a bunch of other shit
- Direct G Protein Actions via the Beta-Gamma Dimer Complex
    - For the purposes of this class, the beta-gamma dimer is also referred to as the beta-gamma subunit complex
    - The beta-gamma dimer directly regulates channels without 2nd messenger intermediates
    - An example of this is ACh muscarinic receptors in the heart and GABAb receptors
