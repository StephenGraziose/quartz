# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/20/23

# Notes:

- GPCRs vs Ionotropic Receptors
    - Ionotropic Receptors
        - Activation leads to channel opening ONLY
        - Local actions (as in, only at the synapse)
        - Rapid on-off response
    - Metabotropic Receptors
        - Activation can lead to the opening OR closing of channels
        - Actions can occur distant from receptors
            - Diffusable messengers
        - Amplification of signals
            - One GPCR can signal to multiple G proteins in a singular neuron
        - Prolonged response: Opening or closing of channels
            - This causes changes in membrane potential occurring
        - Changes in membrane resistance
            - Basically just changes in the membrane's responsivity based on Ohm's Law (V = IR)
- Metabotropic receptors cause slow synaptic "modulation"
    - In contrast to fast excitation/inhibition by glutamate and GABA, metabtropic receptors cause slower modulation of synapses
        - Slower onset, slower offset
        - Slow because it takes a minute for the intracellular signaling cascade to do its thing
- GABA Activation of GABAa and GABAb receptors
    - So basically GABA receptors are like a dimer between **GABAa and GABAb**
    - Fast IPSP: GABAaR's
        - These are ionotropic receptors
    - Slow IPSP: GABAbR's
        - These are metabotropic receptors
- Postsynaptic Modulation
    - Axosomatic and axodendritic synapses
        - Depolarization and hyperpolarization of postsynaptic cell
        - Increase/decrease in conductance (such as the opening or closing of channels)
        - Ex: Glutamate and GABA
            - Glutamate
                - Metabotropic glutamate receptors **(mGluRs)** --> Closing of K+ channels --> Depolarization --> Excitation
            - GABA
                - GABAb receptors --> Opening of K+ channels --> Hyperpolarization --> Inhibition
- Presynaptic Modulation
    - Axoaxonic synapses OR retrograde messenger actions
        - Increases/decreases in neurotransmitter release
            - All regulated by the probability of neurotransmitter release
        - Presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors
            - Cause decrease in glutamate release and decrease in GABA release
        - Presynaptic GABAb receptors
            - Cause decrease in GABA release and decrease in glutamate release
    - Effects of Ca2+ channels on synaptic proteins
        - Metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibit synaptic proteins
        - GABAb receptors inhibit Ca2+ channels
- Presynaptic modulation through spillover
    - **Spillover** is the process that occurs when excess neurotransmitters are released from a neuron into the synaptic cleft and some of the neurotransmitters exit the cleft.
        - These neurotransmitters can bind to GPCRs for other neurons or even the same neuron
            - This leads to a release in GABA that inhibits the initial neuron
    - Basically, my cup runneth over.
        - Or diarrhea in your pants
    - This only works with GABA!
        - This is an inhibitory thing!
- Presynaptic modulation through retrograde messengers
    - **Retrograde messengers** are neurotransmitters that originally are released from a presynaptic neuron and bind to a postsynaptic neuron's receptor on their cell membrane
        - Just like regular, you know?
        - BUT THEN, the postsynaptic cell shits out an endocannabinoid molecule that binds to the presynaptic cell and causes additional glutamate release
            - This only really occurs with glutamate, and causes less excitation in the presynaptic neuron
                - Can cause less future action potentials then
    - Kinda like a clap back
