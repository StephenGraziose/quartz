# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/22/23

# Notes:

- Criteria needed to define a neurotransmitter
    - Synthesized/stored in the presynaptic terminals
        - Analyzed through **immunohistochemistry**
    - Released from synaptic terminals with stimulation
        - Analyzed through **microdialysis and chemical assays**
    - Has specific receptors on postsynaptic cells
        - Analyzed through **neuropharmacology and autoradiography**
- Discovery of Neurotransmitters
    - Initially, scientists were confused if nerve signals were transmitted through electrical or chemical means
    - Experiment by Otto Loewi:
        - Two hearts in two different jars
        - Stimulation of the vagus nerve of one heart occurred
        - The medium of the first heart that was stimulated was transferred to the second heart
        - Results:
            - First heart:
                - Decreased rate and contraction
            - Second heart:
                - Same effects, but delayed
        - Interpretation of results:
            - There must be some chemical transmission of signal going on here
    - Chemical transmission of signal
        - Transmitter involved: ACh ("vagusstoff")
        - Receptors involved: Muscarinic receptors
- Neurotransmitters are proteins
    - Quick recap:
        - There are three types of proteins produced by a cell:
            - Cytosolic proteins
                - Synthesized by free ribosomes
                - Two subtypes:
                    - Fibrillar proteins (cytoskeletal proteins)
                    - Enzymes (metabolic triggers)
            - Nuclear and mitochondrial proteins
                - Translocated to the mitochondria or the nucleus
                    - Ex: Transcription factors
            - Membrane-associated proteins
                - Synthesized by ER-associated proteins
                - Three subtypes:
                    - Proteins attached to the plasma membrane
                        - Integral membrane proteins
                            - Fully implanted into the cell membrane
                        - Peripheral membrane proteins
                            - On one side of the membrane
                    - ER proteins
                    - Proteins contained within secretory vesicles and lysosomes
                        - Includes **secretory products** and enzymes
                            - These secretory products are neurotransmitters
- Types of Neurotransmitters
    - **Small Molecule Neurotransmitters**
        - Amino acids:
            - Excitatory and inhibitory
                - Ex: Glutamate, GABA/Glycine
        - Acetylcholine
        - **Biogenic amines**
            - **Catecholamines**
                - Dopamine, Noradrenaline, adrenaline
            - **Indolamines**
                - Serotonin, melatonin
            - **Histamine**
    - **Neuropeptides**
        - Hypothalamic peptides
        - Opioids
        - Gut peptides
    - **Unconventional Neurotransmitters**
        - Gases
            - Nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide
        - Lipids
            - Endocannbinoids, prostaglandins
        - Growth factors/cytokines
- Synthesis, Transport, and Packaging of Neurotransmitters
    - For small molecule neurotransmitters:
        - Synthesis of **metabolic enzymes** occurs
        - Cytosolic proteins are synthesized by ribosomes
            - Transported to the axon terminals through slow axoplasmic flow
        - Synthesis of neurotransmitter occurs in the axon terminals
        - Vesicular transporters are responsible for uptaking the neurotransmitters into the vesicles
        - Release occurs though exocytosis
    - For neuropeptides:
        - Synthesis of precursor proteins occurs
        - Packaging in **dense-core vesicles**
            - These are formed(?) by membrane proteins
        - Transported to the axon terminals through fast anterograde transport
        - The neurotransmitters are formed by the cleavage of the precursors into the neurotransmitters
        - Release occurs through exocytosis
- Glutamate
    - Excitatory amino acid
    - Synthesis occurs in the terminal
        - Precursor is **glutamine**
        - Synthesis is catalyzed by **glutaminase**
        - Loaded into vesicles by **vesicular glutamate transporters (vGluT)**
    - Release
        - Postsynaptic receptors
            - Ionotropic (AMPA, Kainate, NMDA)
            - Metabotropic (mGluR1-8)
    - Reuptake
        - This is the termination of glutamate actions
        - Glutamate transporters on membranes of astrocytes and neurons (EAATs)
        - Reconversion to glutamine by **glutamine synthetase** in astrocytes
    - Glutamine transfer from astrocytes to neuron axon terminals occurs through glutamine transporters
        - Repackaging and recycling via vesicular glutamate transporters
- GABA
    - Inhibitory amino acid
    - Synthesis occurs in the terminal
        - Precursor is **glutamate**
        - Synthesis is catalyzed by **glutamic acid decarboxylase and pyridoxal phosphate**
