# Notes:

- Formation of Sound Waves
    - Air **compression** (an increase in air pressure) and **rarefaction** (a decrease in air pressure)
        - This generates sound waves
    - Sound waves have waveform characteristics
        - **Frequency:**
            - Pitch or tone
        - **Amplitude:**
            - Height of the peaks
            - Loudness and volume
- Structure of the Ear
    - Outer, middle, and inner ear
        - **Outer Ear**
            - **Pinna**
                - Sound immediately enters through here
            - **Auditory Canal**
                - Once passing the pinna, sound passes through the auditory canal
        - **Middle Ear**
            - **Tympanic Membrane**
                - Ear drum
            - **Ossicles**
                - Small little bones within the ear that connect the tympanic membrane to the inner ear
                    - Consist of the **Malleus, Incus,** and **Stapes**
                    - These are connected to the Oval Window of the Cochlea
        - **Inner Ear**
            - **Vestibular Apparatus**
            - **Cochlea**
                - Coiled tube-like snail shell
                - Has three fluid-filled chambers (they look like pockets in a cross section of the cochlea)
                    - Two large chambers:
                        - **Scala Vestibuli**
                        - **Scala Tympani**
                    - One smaller chamber:
                        - **Scala Media**
                            - This is within the cochlear portion
                            - This contains the **Organ of Corti**
                            - Between the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani
                - Contains the **Helicotrema**
                    - This is the apex of the cochlea
                    - This connects the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani together
                - Contains various fluids
                    - In the Scala Vestibuli and the Scala Tympani:
                        - **Perilymph**
                    - In the Scala Media:
                        - **Endolymph**
                    - These fluids differ in their concentrations of ions, which especially becomes relevant with the hair cells in the Scala Media
- Transduction of Sound
    - This occurs within the Organ of Corti
        - Again, this is located in the Scala Media
        - Contains both inner and outer hair cells
            - They brush and move due to sound waves, which form hair cell receptor potentials
        - Contains two membrane layers that sandwich the organ
            - **Tectorial Membrane**
                - Sits atop of the organ
            - **Basilar Membrane**
                - On the underside of the organ
        - Also contains afferent axons to transfer information to the brain
    - Transduction
        - Fluid waves in the endolymph and perilymph
        - Cause oscillations to occur in the Basilar membrane
            - This causes the movement of hair cells in the Organ
                - This causes the movement of **stereocilia** within the Tectorial Membrane
                    - Stereocilia are small hairs that are bound to hair cells
                        - They start small and gradually increase in size as you move along the hair cell
                            - Short cilia = Small cilia
                            - Long cilia = Large cilia
- Stereocilia Movements
    - Basilar membrane oscillations due to fluid waves causes the forward and backward movements of stereocilia
        - Movements of the stereocilia cause the opening of different ion channels
- Hair Cell Receptor Potential Generation
    - **Endolymph**
        - Contains a high concentration of K+ and a low concentration of Na+
        - +80mV potential
        - K+ potential is 0mV for channels that connect the endolymph to the hair cell
            - EK = 0mV
            - This is a radically different ion situation than normal
    - **Perilymph**
        - Contains a high concentration of Na+ and a low concentration of K+
        - 0mV potential
    - **Hair Cell**
        - -45mV resting potential
        - Extracellular space is the **endolymph**
        - There are K+ channels found on stereocilia
            - Opening these channels causes a depolarization event due to the fact that there is a higher concentration of K+ outside of the cells in the endolymph than inside of the cells
                - This is like the opposite of a typical neuron
            - Closing these channels causes a hyperpolarization event
        - There are also K+ channels found on the base of the hair cell that is submerged in the perilymph
            - Opening these channels causes a hyperpolarization event (K+ efflux from cell rich with K+)
            - Closing these channels causes a depolarization event (More positive charges accumulate)
- Mechano-Electric Transduction
    - Mechanically-Gated K+ Channels
        - Are present on stereocilia
        - Movement toward the long cilia --> Opening of the channel
        - Movement towards the short cilia --> Closing of the channel
        - Stretch causes the opening of channels
    - The opening of ciliar K+ channels
        - This causes an influx of K+
            - This causes the depolarization of the hair cell
                - This causes the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels located at the base of the hair cell
                    - This causes the release of glutamate neurotransmitter
                        - This causes the activation of **Spiral Ganglion Cells**
                            - These are auditory afferents
                            - They're like the 2nd order cells in this chain
                            - Move auditory information to the thalamus and then cortex
- Auditory Signals
    - Sound waves
        - Remember that sound waves are formed through the compression and rarefaction of air
        - Sound waves are **sinusoidal waves**
            - Sine waves
        - Sinusoidal waves in the perilymph cause mechanical pressure to build up on the oval window
            - This causes fluid waves to be set up
    - Opening and closing of mechanically-gated K+ channels
        - Causes the depolarization and hyperpolarization of hair cells, respectively
        - This act reproduces the sinusoidal wave up to high frequencies
- Frequency Sensitivity Tonotopy
    - Basilar membrane
        - The base of the membrane is narrow and rigid
        - The apex of the membrane is wide and flexible
    - The base and apex of the basilar membrane have different frequency sensitivities
        - Base
            - Sensitive to higher frequencies (due to higher rigidity)
        - Apex
            - Sensitive to lower frequencies (due to lower rigidity)
    - Essentially, the basiliar membrane is responsible for being sensitive to the frequency of sounds
    - Tonotopic organization of the cochlea
        - As a result of these sensitivity differences, the cochlea is organized based on coding sounds and their frequencies
            - This leads to different tonotopic transmission to the brain
- Innervation of Hair Cells
    - There is a 3:1 ratio of outer to inner hair cells
    - 95% of all spiral ganglion cells communicate through synapses with inner hair cells
        - Each spiral ganglion cell synapses with single inner hair cell
        - Remember that a ganglion is a collection of cell bodies in the PNS
    - Inner hair cells provide the most information to the brain
        - Very specific to the frequency of sound
    - Outer hair cells help amplify the basilar membrane oscillations when fluid waves pass through
        - Amplify by about 100x
        - This is like their point of existing
- Auditory Pathways
    - You won't have to remember "super mucho" about these pathways (her words, not mine)
        - This is a slight bit complicated though
    - Spiral ganglion connects to the **ventral cochlear nucleus** through the **auditory nerve**
        - The ventral cochlear nucleus then transmits the information to the **superior olive**
            - The superior olive (in the medulla) is neat because this is where information can cross over to the other hemisphere
                - There are two superior olives, one for each hemisphere of the brain
                    - The delay of crossing over to the other hemisphere causes the ability to determine the directionality of sound
            - Dorsal cochlear projections here go to the **inferior colliculus** (in the midbrain)
                - Inferior colliculus projects to the **superior colliculus** and the **Medial Geniculate nucleus** and the cerebellum
                    - This causes integration with vision
                        - This helps coordinate motor output
                            - That's pretty neat!
                    - From the cerebellum, information then travels to the auditory cortex
                        - Tada! That's the way it goes
