# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/27/23

# Notes:

- Common Organization of Sensory Systems
    - **Sensory Transduction**
        - The conversion of a physical signal to a neural signal
        - Encodes four properties of sensations into action potentials
            - Modality
                - What kind of sense?
            - Intensity
                - How strong of that type of sense?
            - Duration
                - How long does that sense last for?
            - Location
                - Where is the stimulus found at?
    - Sensory Receptors
        - Neurons
            - Include sensory neurons such as somatic neurons and olfactory neurons
        - Epithelial cells
            - Include cells such as visual, auditory, and gustatory cells
    - Sensory Afferents (Axons)
        - Arrive at the CNS
        - Remember that afferent means arriving to the CNS and efferent means exiting the CNS
    - Afferent Circuit
        - Usually take a pit stop in the thalamus
            - Huge relay center in the brain
        - Terminate in the appropriate sensory cortex
            - Just dump some information off to some relevant cortical region
- Properties of Sensation -- Modality
    - **5 Main Modalities (qualities)**
        - Vision
        - Hearing
        - Touch
        - Taste
        - Smell
        - **Submodalities**
            - Different qualities within a modality
                - Ex: Touch --> Pressure, temperature, pain
    - Specific receptors associates with each modality/submodality
        - Vision = Photoreceptors
        - Audition = Mechanoreceptors
        - Somatic sensation = Mechanoreceptors, thermoreceptors, nociceptors
            - Proprioception = Chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, nociceptors
        - Taste = Chemoreceptors
        - Smell = Chemoreceptors
    - Each modality is associated with specific central pathways
        - Relay through subnuclei of the thalamus
        - Terminate in specific cortical areas (visual, auditory, somatosensory cortices, olfactory cortex, gustatory area)
- Somatic Sensory Receptors in the Skin
    - Skin Receptors = Transduction
        - Three submodalities:
            - Touch/Pressure
            - Temperature
            - Pain
    - Mechanoreceptors (touch)
        - **Pacinian corpuscle**
            - Receptive field size: Large
            - Adaptation: Fast
        - **Ruffini's endings**
            - Receptive field size: Large
            - Adaptation: Slow
        - **Merkel's disks**
            - Receptive field size: Small
            - Adaptation: Slow
        - **Meissner's corpuscles**
            - Receptive field size: Small
            - Adaptation: Fast
        - Hair follicle receptors
    - Thermoreceptors (temperature)
        - Free nerve endings
            - Just free nerves chilling around lol
    - Nociceptors (pain)
        - Free nerve endings
            - Just free nerves chilling around lol
- Properties of Sensation -- Stimulus Intensity
    - **Threshold**
        - Minimum stimulus strength needed to elicit a response
    - **Intensity**
        - **Frequency coding**
            - Strength of the stimulus is encoded in frequency of action potential discharge in single neurons
                - Greater discharge frequency --> Greater perceived intensity
        - **Population coding**
            - Strength of the stimulus is encoded in several neurons recruited into activity
                - Greater intensity --> Greater number of neurons recruited
                - Greater number of neurons recruited --> Greater perceived intensity
- Properties of Sensation -- Stimulus Location
    - Receptive field of receptors helps determine the location of the specific stimulus
    - Receptor density also helps determine the location of the specific stimulus
        - 2-point discrimination
- **Dermatomes**
    - Receptive fields
        - Sensory area "sensed" by neurons
        - 1st order neurons = Receptor area
        - 2nd order neurons = Convergent signals
    - Dermatomes
        - Sensory areas served by each spinal nerve, dorsal root, and spinal segment
- Properties of Sensation -- Stimulus Duration
    - Adaptation
        - All receptors adapt!
        - Continued stimulation --> Decreased potential amplitude
        - Causes a decreased frequency in action potentials occurring
        - 1st order neurons = Receptor area
    - Slowly adapting receptors
        - Tonic activation
        - Detection of persistent sensory signals
    - Rapidly adapting receptors
        - Rapidly shut off
        - Active only with onset/offset with stimulus
        - Detection of transient sensory signals
- Touch/Pressure Receptor Properties
    - Size of receptive fields
        - Large vs small receptive fields
    - Adaptation to sensory stimulus
        - Fast vs slowly adapting
