# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 3/24/23

# Notes:

- Acetylcholine
    - Synthesis in the terminal
        - Precursors: **Acetyl CoA and Choline** (another amino acid)
        - Catalyzed by **choline acetyltransferase**
    - Release
        - Postsynaptic receptors
            - Ionotropic
                - Nicotonic
                    - Na+/K+ channel
            - Metabotropic
                - Muscarinic
                    - Inhibitory or excitatory
    - Termination (breakdown)
        - Acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine into acetate and choline
    - Reuptake
        - Choline transporters will take up acetylcholine
        - Re-synthesis of acetylcholine
        - Transmitter recycling
- [[Cholinergic Systems]]
    - CNS acetylcholine system is used to diffuse acetylcholine throughout the brain
        - Three distinct sources:
            - **PMT Complex**
                - Diffuse acetylcholine to basal forebrain projections
            - **Basal Nucleus of Meynert**
                - Diffuse acetylcholine to cortical projections
                    - Cortical projections meaning the cerebral cortex (the big part of the brain)
                - Remember that the nucleus are where the cell bodies of all these neurons are, but the ACh gets released from their axons
            - **Medial Septum**
                - Diffuse acetylcholine to cortical and hippocampal projections
                    - Acetylcholine fibers lost in Alzheimer's Disease
                        - Cause issues in memory and attention
    - PNS Acetylcholine system is used to diffuse acetylcholine into somatic and autonomic motor neurons in the peripheral nervous system
        - **Somatic motor neurons**
            - Diffuse acetylcholine to skeletal muscle tissue
        - **Sympathetic preganglionic neurons**
            - Diffuse acetylcholine to sympathetic postganglionic neurons
            - Remember that sympathetic nervous system is that fight or flight system
        - **Parasympathetic pre and post-ganglionic neurons**
            - Diffuse acetylcholine to smooth/cardiac muscle tissues and also glands
            - Remember that the parasympathetic nervous system is that rest and digest system
- Biogenic Amines (Catecholamines)
    - Three big ones
        - **Dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline**
            - I don't believe in typing "epinephrine" out it sounds super cringe
    - Synthesis in the terminal
        - Precursor: **Tyrosine**
        - **Tyrosine hydroxylase** --> DOPA
        - **DOPA decarboxylase** --> Dopamine
        - **Dopamine beta hydroxylase** --> Noradrenaline
        - **PNMT** --> Adrenaline
    - Mood, stress, fluid/energy homeostasis, reward
    - Autonomic function
    - Receptors:
        - Dopamine:
            - Metabotropic D1-D5
        - Noradrenaline:
            - Metabotropic alpha and beta
        - Adrenaline:
            - Metabotropic alpha and beta
    - Transporters
        - Include molecules such as **DAT** and **NET**
- Dopamine Systems
    - Dopamine system is a diffuse modularity system
    - Two main sources of dopamine neurons:
        - **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)**
            - **Striatum (the n. accumbens)** is responsible for reward
            - Frontal cortex is responsible for reward as well
                - Also schizophrenia too
            - **Mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways** originate from here
        - **Substantia Nigra**
            - Striatum is responsible for motor control
                - Damage to this causes Parkinson's Disorder
            - **Nigro-striatal dopamine pathway** originates from here
- Noradrenaline Systems
    - Found in both the CNS and PNS
    - CNS
        - **Locus Coeruleus (in the Pons)**
            - Cortical and cerebellar projections make up the **dorsal noradenergic bundle**
                - Noradrenaline projected here
            - Also spinal projections too
            - This area is a huge source of noradrenaline throughout the brain
        - **Medulla-Brainsteam Noradrenaline System**
            - **Solitary Tract nucleus**
            - **Ventrolateral medulla**
                - Made up by the ventral noradrenergic bundle, subcortical projections
                - Again, another area where noradrenaline is projected
        - These zones diffuse noradrenaline into their projections and are responsible for arousal and mood
    - PNS Systems
        - **Sympathetic postganglionic neurons**
            - Diffuse noradrenaline to smooth/cardiac muscle tissue and glands (beta receptors)
- **Serotonin (5HT)**
    - Synthesis in the terminal:
        - Precursor: Tryptophan
            - Amino acid
        - **Tryptophan-5-hydroxylase** --> 5-hydroxytryptophan
        - **Aromatic L-amino decarboxylase** --> 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) = Serotonin
    - Receptors:
        - 5HT 1-7
        - 5HT 3
            - This is ionotropic
            - Ondansetron!
        - 5HT 4 is not thought to be in the brain
    - Transporters:
        - SERT
- Serotonin Systems
    - **Raphe Nuclei (in brainstem)**
        - Heavy system for serotonin
        - Brain projections = Mood, sleep-wake cycle
        - Spinal projections = pain
        - SSRIs for antidepressants
- **Neuropeptides**
    - Synthesis:
        - Precursor proteins packaged in dense-core vesicles
            - These vesicles have a dense ass core
        - Fast anterograde transport to the terminal
        - Cleave precursors into neurotransmitters
    - Release:
        - ~100 different neuropeptides released by different neurons in the brain
        - Usually co-released with classical neurotransmitters as well
- Co-release of Neurotransmitters
    - Co-localization of transmitters
        - Small molecule NTs and neuropeptides are often located in the same terminals
        - Different location of vesicles
            - Synaptic vesicles (small) at the membrane
            - **Synaptic** **granules (large)** off from the membrane
    - Different conditions of exocytosis
        - Low frequency firing --> low ${[Ca^{2+}]}$ --> small molecule neurotransmitter release
        - High frequency firing --> high ${[Ca^{2+}]}$ --> small molecule neurotransmitter AND neuropeptide release
