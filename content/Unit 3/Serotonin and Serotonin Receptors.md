- **Aromatic L-amino decarboxylase** --> 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) = Serotonin

### Receptors
-  Receptors:
	- 5HT 1-7
	- 5HT 3
		- This is ionotropic
		- Ondansetron!
	- 5HT 4 is not thought to be in the brain
- Transporters:
	- SERT

### Serotonin Systems

	- Heavy system for serotonin
	- Brain projections = Mood, sleep-wake cycle
