There are two major second-messenger systems that are involved with [[Metabotropic Receptors|metabotropic receptors]] within the Nervous System: the **cAMP System** and the **Phosphoinositol System**

### cAMP System
- **Gs** and **Gi**
	- **Gs**
		- Title is "G alpha s"
		- *Stimulatory* G protein
		- Stimulates **adenylyl cyclase**
			- This is an enzyme that generates cAMP (cyclic AMP) from ATP
			- cAMP production increases
	- **Gi**
		- Title is "G alpha i"
		- *Inhibitory* G protein
		- Inhibits adenylyl cyclase
			- cAMP production decreases
- cAMP activates **cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) (PKA)**
	- PKA is a secondary effector that leads to the phosphorylation of target proteins

### Phosphoinositol System
- **Gq**
	- Title is "G alpha q"
	- A G protein that stimulates **phospholipase C (PLC)**
		- PLC leads to the production of **inositol triphosphate (IP3)** and **diacyl glycerol (DAG)** from **PIP2** (a membrane lipid precursor)
- IP3
	- Inositol triphosphate leads to the release of Ca2+ from the intracellular stores at the SER
            - Increases [Ca2+]
- DAG
	- Diacyl glycerol activates **protein kinase C (PKC)**
		- This protein kinase's activity is dependent on Ca2+ concentration
		- PKC goes on and does a bunch of other shit
