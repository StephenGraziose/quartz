The **Visual System** is responsible for receiving and processing of visual signals in order to generate sight.

### Light Properties
- Remember that **light is just electromagnetic radiation**
	- The Electromagnetic Spectrum
		- <400nm = **UV, X-rays, Gamma rays**
		- 400-700nm = **Visible light**
		- >700nm = **infrared,** **radar, etc.
- Light is **reflected, absorbed, and refracted**
	- Reflection:
		- Light just bounces off of surfaces
	- Absorption
		- Light is absorbed by other surfaces
	- Refraction
		- Light can bend when moving through a surface
			- When light passes through the lens of our eye, it is refracted
- Lower wavelength = Higher frequency = Higher energy

### Image Formation
- **Light Refraction**
        - Bending of light
            - This occurs because light is passing through different media
            - **Focal distance:**
                - The cornea of the eye to the convergence point
    - **Accommodation**
        - Refraction by the lens of the eye
        - Focuses on the retina
        - This occurs though the shape of the lens of the eye

### The Eye
- The eye is the major sensory organ of the visual system
	- The eye contains:
		- **Cornea and Lens**
			- These are both responsible for the refraction of light
			- They are both focused at the retina
				- Accommodation: Lens shape changes with distance of object (rounder for closer objects, involves ciliary muscles)
		- [[The Retina]]
