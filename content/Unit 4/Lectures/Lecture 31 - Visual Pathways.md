- There are 3 distinct retinal projections:
	- The *Optic Nerve*
	- The *Optic Chiasm*
	- The *Optic Tract*
- There are 4 targets that [[Ganglion Cells|ganglion cells]] are able to project to:
	- **Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus**
		- This is used for perception
	- **Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus**
		- This is used for circadian rhythms (for sleep and wakefulness)
	- **Pretectum**
		- This is used for pupil and lens reflexes
			- This causes the size of the pupil to fluctuate
	- **Superior colliculus**
		- This is used for head and eye movement
		- Orients the eyes in response to stimuli
- The pathway to the visual cortex is as follows:
	- <font color="#9bbb59">Ganglion cells -> Optic Nerves --> Optic Chiasm --> Optic Tract --> LGN --> Optic Radiation --> Primary Visual Cortex</font>
- Outputs of the Retina: Retinal Ganglion Cells
	- Three types of information transmitted by ganglion cells:
		1. Form
		2. Color
		3. Motion
	- Transmitted by three types of ganglion cells:
		- **M-type (parasol cells)**
			- These are large cells
			- Project to <u>magnocellular</u> layers of LGN
			- Carry *position and motion information*
			- Large receptive field
			- Faster action potential conduction
			- Respond to low-contrast light
			- Transient (adaptive) response to center light
			- Transmit movement information
			- Totally insensitive to color
		- **P-type (midget cells)**
			- These are small cells
			- Project to <u>parvocellular</u> layers of LGN
			- Carry *form and color (red/green) information*
			- Smaller receptive field
			- Slower action potential conduction
			- Sustained and constant response to center light
		- **K-type (bistratisfied/"Non-M-Non-P cells")**
			- These cells are super fucking small, but have massive receptive fields with only centers
				- Always ON to the blue cone and OFF to the red and green cones
			- Project to <u>konicellular</u> regions, between the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the LGN
			- Carry *color (blue/yellow) information*
