# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 4/24/23

# Notes:

- Center-Surround Receptive Fields
    - These look like concentric circles (like vinyl record disks)
        - A bipolar neuron is going to be basically on the center of the disk and there's gonna be a sort of area surrounding the center of the disk that can be stimulated
            - Below the bipolar cell is a ganglion cell that is attempting to communicate visual informational cells to the brain
                - The ganglion cell gets information from the bipolar cell
                    - The bipolar cell gets information from the photoreceptor cells (rods and cones)
    - **Direct (vertical) Pathways:**
        - These are located at the **center** of the receptive field
    - **Indirect (lateral/horizontal) Pathways:**
        - These are **surrounding** the receptive field
- The reason we have these receptive fields is to have contrast in our vision
- Receptive Fields
    - **Ganglion Cell Receptive Fields**:
        - This is the area of the retina that the ganglion cell responds to
            - This is basically the convergence of interneurons onto the ganglion cell
                - Multiple cells are communicating with the same ganglion cell
    - **Center-Surround Receptive Fields:**
        - Circular concentric center/surround
            - Relationship between the center and the surroundings is always antagonistic
                - Opposite responses to each other
        - On-Center and Off-Center ganglion cells
            - **On-Center**
                - Excited by center light
                - Inhibited by surrounding light
            - **Off-Center**
                - Excited by surrounding light
                - Inhibited by center light
            - **Both the on-center and off-center ganglion cells will communicate distinct messages**
    - These receptive fields are tuned for contrast detection
        - Diffuse light elicits little response
- **Center Pathways**
    - Easiest pathway to know (still very complicated)
    - **Direct or vertical pathways to ganglion cells**
        - Almost direct communication between photoreceptor and the ganglion cell (bipolar cell in the middle)
        - These pathways mediate the center response, either on or off
        - Signals relayed from cones --> bipolar cells --> ganglion cells
    - On/off signals depend on the bipolar cells
        - **On-center bipolar cell = Depolarizes**
        - **Off-center bipolar cell = Hyperpolarizes**
    - Cone and on-center bipolar cell synapse:
        - This is an **inhibitory synapse that uses metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)** 
        - Hyperpolarization of the cone occurs when light strikes
            - Decrease in glutamate release occurs from the cone
                - This causes a **depolarization event in the on-center bipolar cell** because the receptors on the **on-center bipolar cell are** **inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors**
                    - Less glutamate release means more excitation of these on-center bipolar cells
    - Cone and off-center bipolar cell synapse:
        - This is an **excitatory synapse that uses ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)**
        - Hyperpolarization of the cone occurs when light strikes
            - Decrease in glutamate release occurs from the cone
                - This causes a **hyperpolarization event in the off-center bipolar cell** because the receptors on the **off-center bipolar cell are excitatory ionotropic glutamate receptors**
                    - Less glutamate release means less excitation of these off-center bipolar cells
    - Bipolar cell --> Ganglion cell synapse
        - This is an **excitatory synapse that uses ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)**
        - Depolarization of the bipolar cell results in more glutamate being released onto the ganglion cell, causing excitation
        - Hyperpolarization of the bipolar cell results in less glutamate being released onto the ganglion cell, causing inhibition
- **Surround Pathways**
    - These are like slightly harder to understand lol
    - This is like the outer ring of the donut that is the receptive field of a ganglion cell
        - Cones exist on the outer surrounding area of the donut
            - They also may be in the center area of other ganglion cells too
        - This is an indirect and lateral pathway to ganglion cells
            - Mediate surround response, on or off
            - Cone in surrounding cell --> Horizontal cell --> Cone in center --> Bipolar cell in the center pathway --> Ganglion cell
    - **Do not even try to read her slides the words on each slide here are straight up illegible**
    - **Horizontal cells lead to a cone synapse** for surrounding cones
        - Will cause less glutamate release occurring due to hyperpolarizing
        - This is an **inhibitory synapse that uses ionotropic GABA receptors (GABAa)**
            - Horizontal cells are GABAergic
                - Will receive glutamate from the cones (has glutamate receptors), and releases GABA from the cones
                    - So when the cone cell has light shone on it, it will release less glutamate, which will cause horizontal cells to release less GABA, which will cause center ganglion cells to depolarize, which will mimic dark conditions (REMEMBER THAT DEPOLARIZATION = DARK)
    - **If light hits the surrounding cone, they will attempt to shut off the center ganglion cell!** 
    - All signals are reversed with respect to the center response
        - Depolarization of the center cone --> Increase in glutamate release
    - On-center bipolar cell = Hyperpolarization, which means less glutamate release
        - This causes hyperpolarization of the on-center ganglion cell, meaning less action potentials
    - Off-center bipolar cell = Depolarization, which means more glutamate release
        - This causes depolarization of the off-center ganglion cell, meaning more action potentials
- **Rod Pathways**
    - Indirect pathway always
        - This occurs using rod bipolar cells and also amacrine cells
    - **Rod bipolar cells**
        - These are on-center bipolar cells
            - Only one type of bipolar cell lol
            - When light shines on the rod, it is depolarized
                - Less glutamate released
                    - This depolarizes the on-center bipolar cells, which in turn depolarize the ganglion cells (make sure that this is depolarization and not hyperpolarization)
    - **Amacrine cells**
        - These cells are responsible for action potential generation
        - **Glycine** is the neurotransmitter involved here
            - Amacrine cells release glycine when action potentials go down their axons
                - They're literally just like other neurons
        - **Electrical synapses** with the on-center ganglion cells are **excitatory**
        - **Chemical synapses** with the off-center ganglion cells are **inhibitory**
            - Excitation of on-center cells and inhibition of off-center ganglion cells
- Action Potentials in the Retinal Circuit
    - Cones/Rods **DO NOT** generate action potentials
    - Bipolar cells **DO NOT** generate action potentials
    - Horizontal cells **DO NOT** generate action potentials
    - Ganglion cells **DO** generate action potentials
    - Amacrine cells **DO** generate action potentials
