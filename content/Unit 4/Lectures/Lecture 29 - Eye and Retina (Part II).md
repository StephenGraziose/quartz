# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 4/21/23

# Notes:

- Phototransduction
    - This is the conversion of light information into a neural signal
    - **Rhodopsin** is the rod photopigment that is involved within this process
        - Rhodopsin contains two important components: **Opsin** and **Retinal**
            - **Opsin**
                - Opsin is a GPCR that interacts with retinal, triggering a 2nd messenger cascade in the retina
            - **Retinal**
                - Retinal is a light-absorbing molecule that is a derivative of Vitamin A
            - When retinal interacts with light, it converts from 11-cis-retinal to entirely trans retinal, which activates opsin
                - This triggers a 2nd messenger cascade in the retina
- 2nd Messenger Cascade
    - In the retina, the G protein responsible for the 2nd messenger cascade for phototransduction is **transducin**
        - When activated, cGMP phosphodiesterase takes **cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)** and converts it into **5'GMP (5' guanosine monophosphate)**
            - This leads to a **decrease in the concentration of cGMP** in cells
                - This triggers a closing of cGMP-gated Na+ channels
                    - This causes a blockage of "dark current" (electrical current that is activated in the dark)
                        - This causes **hyperpolarization** (this is called passive signaling)
    - To see light:
        - Depolarizing dark current must be blocked and hyperpolarizing light current must be transmitted in order to cause photoreceptor cells to detect light and initiate the visual signal processing cascade
    - To see darkness:
        - Depolarizing dark current must prevail to have photoreceptor cells keep seeing darkness and continue seeing it
    - Photoreceptors constantly have sodium inwardly flowing into them (depolarizing) in darkness
        - Exposure to light inhibits this and triggers photoreception
- Red, Green, and Blue Cones
    - **Color Vision** 
        - The ability to perceive colors is caused by the differential activation of red, green, and blue cones
    - There are multiple different visual anomalies that can occur due to differences in the amount of cones in the retina
        - **Protanomaly**:
            - Reduced sensitivity to red light due to lacking red cones
        - **Deuteranomaly**
            - Reduced sensitivity to green light due to lacking green cones (most common)
        - **Tritanomaly:**
            - Reduced sensitivity to blue light due to lacking blue cones (most rare)
- Retinal Circuits
    - There are five different cell types in the retina:
        - Photoreceptors
        - Bipolar cells
        - Horizontal cells
        - Amacrine cells
        - Ganglion cells
    - There are also five different layers of the retina:
        - Outer nuclear layer
        - Outer plexiform layer
        - Inner nuclear layer
        - Inner plexiform layer
        - Ganglion cell layer
    - Retinal circuits involve these cells and these layers where these cells live in
- Basic Retinal Circuit
    - Processing of visual signals:
        - Photoreceptors (the rods and cones) --> Interneurons --> Ganglion cells
    - **Interneurons involved:**
        - **Bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells**
    - **Ganglion cells**
        - These are the **output cells** of the retina
            - Contain axons that form the optic nerve and project into the brain
                - This forms the **optic disk** as well
                    - This is the blind spot for our vision
            - Visual information is transmitted to the brain by action potentials
