# Information:

#### Class: NSCI-3310

#### Date: 5/3/23

# Notes:

- This is the newest untested material on the final
	- Remember that the final is 25% of each unit
		- Essentially fully cumulative
	- Nothing in the final review powerpoint that we haven't covered is on the final
- This unit was mostly on the eye and the retina
	- *Most questions come from the eye and retina of the visual system*
		- Essentially, just care about this part of the exam
- Properties of Light
	- Light is electromagnetic radiation
	- Visible light is between 400nm and 700nm
- The Eye
	- Cornea and Lens
		- Refraction of lens, focused at the retina
		- Accomodation
			- Lens shape changes with the distance of the object
	- Retina
		- Layered structure that covers 3/4ths of the inside of the eye
			- Photoreceptors capture photons and perform phototransduction
			- Fovea is the center of the retina and is the region of highest visual acuity
	- Pigment epithelium
		- Melanin-containing cells that contain stray light that miss any of the receptors in the retina
			- Is like essentially the final layer of the retina
- The Retina
	- 5 layers
		- **Outer nuclear layer**
			- Contains photoreceptors
		- **Outer plexiform layer**
			- Contains synapses between the photoreceptors and the interneurons
		- **Inner nuclear layer**
			- Contains interneurons
		- **Inner plexiform layer**
			- Contains synapses between the interneurons and the ganglion cells
		- **Ganglion cell layer**
			- Contains ganglion cells
- Light Path to Photoreceptors
	- Photoreceptors are located in the outer nuclear layer
	- The light path to the photoreceptors is impeded by other layers
	- Fovea:
		- Layers parted to allow *direct* light access to the photoreceptors
- Photoreceptors
	- Rods and cones
	- **Rods**
		- Detects low levels of light (cannot detect color due to having no opsins and only **rhodopsin**)
		- High sensitivity, low spatial resolution
			- More visual pigment, more convergence on bipolar and ganglion cells
				- Rods communciate to many bipolar and ganglion cells at once
	- **Cones**
		- Contains red, green, and blue opsins
			- Can detect color
			- Each different pigment responds to different wavelengths of light
		- Low sensitivity, high spatial resolution
			- Less visual pigment, less convergence (often a 1:1 cone to ganglion cell ratio)
- Phototransduction
	- Rhodopsin
		- Rod photopigment
	- Opsin:
		- GPCR for vision, very unique GPCR
			- Photons will be the ligand for this!
	- Retinal
		- Light-absorbing derivative of Vitamin A
	- When photons hit the eye, retinal undergoes a conformational change from 11-cis retina to all-trans retinal, which activates opsin and triggers the 2nd messenger cascade
	- 2nd messenger cascade
		- The G-protein in this system is **transducin**
			- cGMP phosphodiesterase --> cGMP to 5'GMP (decreases the concentration of cGMP)
				- Causes the closing of cGMP-gated Na+ channels
					- This blocks "dark current" (*in darkness, there is constant depolarization occurring*)
						- This causes hyperpolarization (through less glutamate being released to the ganglion cells)
					- The membrane potential of a rod cell is *-40mV*
- Retinal Circuits
	- There are 5 cell types that are crucial within the eyes
		- Photoreceptors
		- Bipolar cells
			- Vertical pathway, connects photoreceptors to the center ganglion cells
		- Horizontal cells
			- Horizontal pathway, connects photoreceptors to surrounding ganglion cells
		- Amacrine cells
		- Ganglion cells
	- Remember those previous 5 layers of the retina as well
		- Remember which cells live in which layers as well
- Center-surround receptive fields
	- Direct (vertical) pathways
		- **Center** of the receptive field
	- Indirect (horizontal) pathways
		- **Surround** of the receptive field
	- Essentially, ganglion cells have receptive fields that include a center and a surrounding
		- There is a convergence of interneurons onto the ganglion cells
		- There is an antagonistic effect between the center and the surround
