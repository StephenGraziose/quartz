**Final exam is 25% of each and every unit!**

- Properties of Light
    - Remember that **light is just electromagnetic radiation**
    - The Electromagnetic Spectrum
        - <400nm = **UV, X-rays, Gamma rays**
        - 400-700nm = **Visible light**
        - >700nm = **infrared,** **radar, etc.
    - Light is **reflected, absorbed, and refracted**
        - Reflection:
            - Light just bounces off of surfaces
        - Absorption
            - Light is absorbed by other surfaces
        - Refraction
            - Light can bend when moving through a surface
                - When light passes through the lens of our eye, it is refracted
- Lower wavelength = Higher frequency = Higher energy
- Image Formation
    - **Light Refraction**
        - Bending of light
            - This occurs because light is passing through different media
            - **Focal distance:**
                - The cornea of the eye to the convergence point
    - **Accommodation**
        - Refraction by the lens of the eye
        - Focuses on the retina
        - This occurs though the shape of the lens of the eye
- The Eye
    - **Cornea and Lens**
        - These are both responsible for the refraction of light
        - They are both focused at the retina
            - Accommodation: Lens shape changes with distance of object (rounder for closer objects, involves ciliary muscles)
    - **Retina**
        - Layered structure that covers 3/4ths of the inside of the eye
        - **Photoreceptors** are present in the retina:
            - These capture photons and are responsible for phototransduction
            - They live at the back at the retina
        - **Fovea**
            - Center of the retina, region of high visual acuity
            - Center point, where all of light converges
                - All light converges to this point
                    - Light has total access to the photoreceptors here
- **Pigment Epithelium**
    - Contains melanin-containing cells
    - Absorbs stray light that was not caught by the photoreceptors of the retina
- The Retina
    - Contains 5 layers:
        - **Outer nuclear layer**
            - Contains photoreceptors
                - This is where the photoreceptors live
            - Axons go to outer plexiform layer
        - **Outer plexiform layer**
            - Contains synapses
            - Axons go to the inner nuclear layer
        - **Inner nuclear layer**
            - Contains interneurons
            - Axons go to inner plexiform layer
        - **Inner plexiform layer**
            - Contains synapses
            - Axons synapse with the ganglion cell layer
        - **Ganglion cell layer**
            - Axons exit the back hole of the eye and form the optic nerve bundle
- Light Path to Photoreceptors
    - Photoreceptors
        - Located in the outer nuclear layer (outermost layer)
        - Light path to photoreceptors is impeded by other layers
        - At the fovea, the other layers are parted to allow **direct light access to photoreceptors**
            - Least distortion of light
            - Located in the center of the retina, directly behind the cornea and the lens
            - Highest concentration of photoreceptors (cones) results in high acuity
                - Highest image clarity
- Photoreceptors
    - **Rods and Cones**
        - Outer segment of these cells are **discs**
            - Kinda like the dendrites
            - Little layers of membrane that contain receptors
            - Rods are very cylindrical and cones are very cone-like
        - Inner segment of these cells are **soma and the synaptic terminal**
            - Soma is cell body
            - Synaptic terminal is just like an axon terminal
                - Secretes neurotransmitter
    - **Rods**
        - **Night vision**
        - Single visual pigment: **Rhodopsin**
            - Cannot detect color
            - Is not color specific at all
        - **High sensitivity, low spatial resolution (low visual acuity)**
            - More visual pigment, more convergence on bipolar/ganglion cells
            - Is able to just see that something was there or that something moved, but not able to detect the clarity of it
        - Rods are more sensitive to light due to having more discs and having a larger surface area than cones
    - **Cones**
        - **Light vision**
        - Three visual pigments: Red, green, and blue opsin
            - Can detect color
            - Each pigment responds to different wavelengths of light
        - **Low sensitivity, high spatial resolution (high visual acuity)**
            - Less visual pigment, less convergence
                - Often 1:1 cone to ganglion cell ratio
        - Cones are less sensitive to light due to having less discs and having a lower surface area than rods
- Factors Contributing to Visual Acuity
    - Convergence of photoreceptor signals
        - Multiple receptors can respond to a single source of light (there is overlap in the receptive fields of the receptors)
    - Light access to photoreceptors
    - Distribution of photoreceptors
        - More rods in an area = Better night vision
        - More cones in an area = Better light vision
