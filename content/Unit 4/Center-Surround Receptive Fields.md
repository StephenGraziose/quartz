The receptive fields of the [[Ganglion Cells]] are pretty strange. Essentially, each receptive field looks like a concentric circle, with a distinct center of the circle and a distinct surrounding of the circle, sort of like this:

 - **Ganglion Cell Receptive Fields**:
	- This is the area of the retina that the ganglion cell responds to
	- This is basically the convergence of interneurons onto the ganglion cell
		- Multiple cells are communicating with the same ganglion cell
    - **Center-Surround Receptive Fields:**
		- Circular concentric center/surround
			- Relationship between the center and the surroundings is always antagonistic
				- Opposite responses to each other
- On-Center and Off-Center ganglion cells
	-  **On-Center**
		- Excited by center light
		- Inhibited by surrounding light
		- Known fully as *On-Center, Off-surround*
	- **Off-Center**
		- Excited by surrounding light
		- Inhibited by center light
		- Known fully as *Off-Center, On-surround*
	- **Both the on-center and off-center ganglion cells will communicate distinct messages**
    - These receptive fields are tuned for contrast detection
        - Diffuse light elicits little response
