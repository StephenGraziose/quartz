The **Retina** is a layered structure that contains 3/4ths of the inside of the eye, as well as [[Photoreceptors|photoreceptors]], the **Fovea**, and the **Pigment Epithelium**. 

The retina is also where [[Retinal Circuits|retinal circuits]] exist for [[phototransduction]] to occur

### Layers of the Retina
 - **Outer nuclear layer**
	- Contains photoreceptors
		- This is where the photoreceptors live
	- Axons go to outer plexiform layer
- **Outer plexiform layer**
	- Contains synapses
	- Axons go to the inner nuclear layer
- **Inner nuclear layer**
	- Contains interneurons
	- Axons go to inner plexiform layer
- **Inner plexiform layer**
	- Contains synapses
	- Axons synapse with the ganglion cell layer
- **Ganglion cell layer**
	- Axons exit the back hole of the eye and form the optic nerve bundle

### Fovea
- *Center of the retina*, region of *highest visual acuity*
	- Center point, where all of light converges
		- All light converges to this point
			- Light has total access to the photoreceptors here

### Pigment Epithelium
- Contains melanin-containing cells
	- Absorbs stray light that was not caught by the photoreceptors of the retina

### Cells in the Retina
- [[Photoreceptors]]
- **Bipolar cells**
- **Horizontal cells**
- **Amacrine cells**
- [[Ganglion cells]]
