**Phototransduction** is the conversion of light information into a neural signal.

### Overview of Phototransduction
- **Rhodopsin** is the rod photopigment that is involved within this process
	- Rhodopsin contains two important components: **Opsin** and **Retinal**
		- **Opsin**
			- Opsin is a [[Metabotropic Receptors|GPCR]] that interacts with retinal, triggering a 2nd messenger cascade in the retina
		- **Retinal**
			- Retinal is a light-absorbing molecule that is a derivative of Vitamin A
		- When retinal interacts with light, it converts from 11-cis-retinal to entirely trans retinal, which activates opsin
			- This triggers a 2nd messenger cascade in the retina
				- In the retina, the G protein responsible for the 2nd messenger cascade for phototransduction is **transducin**
					- When activated, cGMP phosphodiesterase takes **cGMP (cyclic guanosine monophosphate)** and converts it into **5'GMP (5' guanosine monophosphate)**
						- This leads to a **decrease in the concentration of cGMP** in cells
							- This triggers a closing of cGMP-gated Na+ channels
								- This causes a blockage of "dark current" (electrical current that is activated in the dark)
									- This causes **hyperpolarization** (this is called passive signaling)

### How to See
 - **To see light**:
	- Depolarizing dark current must be blocked and hyperpolarizing light current must be transmitted in order to cause photoreceptor cells to detect light and initiate the visual signal processing cascade
- **To see darkness**:
	- Depolarizing dark current must prevail to have photoreceptor cells keep seeing darkness and continue seeing it
- *Photoreceptors constantly have sodium inwardly flowing into them (depolarizing) in darkness*
	- *Exposure to light inhibits this* and triggers photoreception
