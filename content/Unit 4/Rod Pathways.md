**Rod Pathways** are another type of [[phototransduction]] pathway, this time relying only on rods and being an indirect pathway.

**Rod bipolar cells**
- These are **on-center bipolar cells**
	- Only one type of bipolar cell
		- When light shines on the rod, it is depolarized
			- Less glutamate released
				- This depolarizes the on-center bipolar cells (since they have inhibitory mGluRs), which in turn depolarize the ganglion cells
    - **Amacrine cells**
	- These cells are responsible for action potential generation
        - **Glycine** is the neurotransmitter involved here
		- Amacrine cells release glycine when action potentials go down their axons
			- They're literally just like other neurons
	- **Electrical synapses** with the on-center ganglion cells are **excitatory**
	- **Chemical synapses** with the off-center ganglion cells are **inhibitory**
		- Excitation of on-center cells and inhibition of off-center ganglion cells
