**Photoreceptors** are receptor cells that interact with photons and begin the process of [[Phototransduction]].  They live in the **Outer nuclear layer** of [[The Retina]] and consist of two types of cells: **Cones** and **Rods**.

### Common Features Between Cones and Rods
- Outer segment of these cells are **discs**
	- Kinda like the dendrites
	- Little layers of membrane that contain receptors
	- Rods are very cylindrical and cones are very cone-like
- Inner segment of these cells are **soma and the synaptic terminal**
	- Soma is cell body
	- Synaptic terminal is just like an axon terminal
		- Secretes neurotransmitter

### Cones
- **Cones**
	- **Light vision**
	- Three visual pigments: Red, green, and blue opsin
		- Can detect color
		- Each pigment responds to different wavelengths of light
	- **Low sensitivity, high spatial resolution (high visual acuity)**
		- Less visual pigment, less convergence
			- Often 1:1 cone to ganglion cell ratio
	- Cones are less sensitive to light due to having less discs and having a lower surface area than rods
- **Color Vision**
	- The ability to perceive colors is caused by the differential activation of red, green, and blue cones
	- There are multiple different visual anomalies that can occur due to differences in the amount of cones in the retina
		- **Protanomaly**:
			- Reduced sensitivity to red light due to lacking red cones
		- **Deuteranomaly**
			- Reduced sensitivity to green light due to lacking green cones (most common)
		- **Tritanomaly:**
			- Reduced sensitivity to blue light due to lacking blue cones (most rare)

### Rods
- **Night vision**
	- Single visual pigment: **Rhodopsin**
		- Cannot detect color
		- Is not color specific at all
	- **High sensitivity, low spatial resolution (low visual acuity)**
		- More visual pigment, more convergence on bipolar/ganglion cells
		- Is able to just see that something was there or that something moved, but not able to detect the clarity of it
	- Rods are more sensitive to light due to having more discs and having a larger surface area than cones


### Factors Contributing to Visual Acuity
- Convergence of photoreceptor signals
	- Multiple receptors can respond to a single source of light (there is overlap in the receptive fields of the receptors)
- Light access to photoreceptors
- Distribution of photoreceptors
	- More rods in an area = Better night vision
	- More cones in an area = Better light vision
