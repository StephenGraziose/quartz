**Surround Pathways** are another type of [[phototransduction]] pathway:

- This is like the outer ring of the donut that is the receptive field of a ganglion cell
	- Cones exist on the outer surrounding area of the donut
		- They also may be in the center area of other ganglion cells too
	- This is an indirect and lateral pathway to ganglion cells
		- Mediate surround response, on or off
		- Cone in surrounding cell --> Horizontal cell --> Cone in center --> Bipolar cell in the center pathway --> Ganglion cell
    - **Horizontal cells lead to a cone synapse** for surrounding cones
        - Will cause less glutamate release occurring due to hyperpolarizing
        - This is an **inhibitory synapse that uses ionotropic GABA receptors (GABAa)**
            - Horizontal cells are GABAergic
                - Will receive glutamate from the cones (has glutamate receptors), and releases GABA from the cones
                    - So when the cone cell has light shone on it, it will release less glutamate, which will cause horizontal cells to release less GABA, which will cause center ganglion cells to depolarize, which will mimic dark conditions (REMEMBER THAT DEPOLARIZATION = DARK)
    - **If light hits the surrounding cone, they will attempt to shut off the center ganglion cell!** 
    - All signals are reversed with respect to the center response
        - Depolarization of the center cone --> Increase in glutamate release
    - On-center bipolar cell = Hyperpolarization, which means less glutamate release
        - This causes hyperpolarization of the on-center ganglion cell, meaning less action potentials
    - Off-center bipolar cell = Depolarization, which means more glutamate release
        - This causes depolarization of the off-center ganglion cell, meaning more action potentials
