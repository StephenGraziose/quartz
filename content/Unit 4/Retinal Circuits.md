**Retinal Circuits** are neural circuits that are used to process visual signals within [[The Retina]].

The typical pathway for a retinal circuit goes [[Photoreceptors]] --> **Interneurons** --> [[Ganglion Cells]]

Photoreceptors involved: **Rods and Cones**

Interneurons involved: **Bipolar cells, Horizontal cells , Amacrine cells**

There are two types of visual pathways:
- **Direct (Vertical) Pathways**
	- These are located at the **center** of the receptive field
- **Indirect (Horizontal) Pathways**
	- These are **surrounding** the receptive field

There are three important visual pathways (which are essentially types of retinal circuits), two of which are related to cones and one of which is related to rods:
- [[Center Pathways]]
- [[Surround Pathways]]
- [[Rod Pathways]]

- Action Potentials in the Retinal Circuit
	- Cones/Rods **DO NOT** generate action potentials
	- Bipolar cells **DO NOT** generate action potentials
	- Horizontal cells **DO NOT** generate action potentials
	- Ganglion cells **DO** generate action potentials
	- Amacrine cells **DO** generate action potentials
